Welcome to AppDaemon's documentation!
=====================================

AppDaemon is a loosely coupled, multithreaded, sandboxed python
execution environment for writing automation apps for home automation projects, and any environment that requires a robust event driven architecture.

Out of the box, AppDaemon has support for the following automation products:

- `Home Assistant <https://home-assistant.io/>`__ home automation software.
- `MQTT <http://mqtt.org/>`__ event broker.

AppDaemon also provides a configurable dashboard (HADashboard) suitable for wall mounted tablets.

AppDaemon is developed and maintained by a small team of hard working folks:

- `Andrew Cockburn <https://github.com/acockburn>`__ - AppDaemon founder, Chief Architect and Benevolent Dictator For Life.
- `Rene Tode <https://github.com/ReneTode>`__ - Head Product abuser and alternate point of view expert.
- `Odianosen Ejale <https://github.com/Odianosen25>`__ - MQTT Development and maintenance, fixer and tester.
- `Humberto Rodríguez Avila <https://github.com/rhumbertgz>`__ - Document Meister and Code Groomer
- `Daniel Lashua <https://github.com/dlashua>`__ - JS/CSS/HTML expert and the one that drives them all crazy.
