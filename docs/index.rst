   contain the root `doctree` directive.

Welcome to AppDaemon's documentation!
=====================================

AppDaemon is a loosely coupled, multi-threaded, sandboxed python
execution environment for writing automation apps for home automation projects, and any environment that requires a robust event driven architecture.

Out of the box, AppDaemon has support for the following automation products:

- `Home Assistant <https://home-assistant.io/>`__ home automation software.
- `MQTT <http://mqtt.org/>`__ event broker.

AppDaemon also provides a configurable dashboard (HADashboard) suitable for wall mounted tablets.

A Note on Release Velocity
==========================

AppDaemon has reached a very stable point, works reliably and is fairly feature rich at this point
in its development. For that reason, releases have been slow in recent months. This does not mean that AppDaemon has been abandoned - it is used every day by
the core developers, and has an active community onm Discord (see below).

Assistance
==========

- AppDaemon has a dedicated sub-forum over at `Home Assistant <https://community.home-assistant.io/c/third-party/appdaemon/21>`__
- We also have an active discord server `here <https://discord.gg/qN7c7JcFjk>`__ - please join us for tips and tricks,
AppDaemon discussions and general home automation!
