Stream stuff:

The provides a framework for JSON based requests and responses in stream.

Requests are JSON arrays that contain a "request_type" key.
Optionally "request_id" can be sent in order to track the response.
The "data" key is used for data to be sent to the request.

Responses come with a "response_type" key equal to the request_type. If "request_id" was sent, "response_id" will be provided. "response_success" will be true or false. If false, "response_error" will be provided as well as "request" which contains the original request. If the response is successful, data MAY be provided if the request returned data. If a request_id is sent, a response message will always be generated, even if there is no data.

The following requests types are established:

hello
Requires a client_name key
Accepts a password key with a plain text password
Accepts a cookie key with a browser authorization cookie
Will allow no password if none is set in AD config.

listen_state
Requires a namespace key. * wildcard supported at the end of the string
Requires an entity_id key. * wildcard supported at the end of the string

listen_event
Requires a namespace key. * wildcard supported at the end of the string.
Requires an event key. * wildcard supported at the end of the string.

get_state
Requires no parameters. Returns all states in AppDaemon

call_service:
requires namespace, domain, service
optionally, data can be provided for service data.

I've marked this as a WIP as I will continue to add request_types as a need is presented. Any request_type requiring less than simple code will be placed in its own PR.
