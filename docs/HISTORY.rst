Change Log
==========

4.0.6
-----

**Features**

- Added ability for apps to create namespaces, and remove the created namespace. This namespaces are persistent by default
- Added ability to persist plugin entities. This can be usefule for example if wanting to persist entities within MQTT namespace
- Moved the `appdaemon` reladed services to the `admin` namespace. So no more `appdaemon` namespace
- Added services for creating, editting, removing, enabling, disabling apps
- Added ability to receive binary payload from MQTT broker
- Added `cchardet <https://pypi.org/project/cchardet>`__ and `aiodns <https://pypi.org/project/aiodns>`__ to improve aiohttp speed
- Added the ability to submit tasks to executor threads

**Fixes**

- Fixed issue where when an app is stopped using api, when started it doesn't respect the previous pin given to it by AD
- Documentation fixes - contributed by `Ross Rosen <https://github.com/rr326>`__
- Allowed for both multi and single level MQTT wildcard subscription
- Diabled the ability to use a "." in app name. Contributed by `Xavi Moreno <https://github.com/xaviml>`__

**Breaking Changes**

- If using user defined namespace, there is need to delete the present ones in the ``namespaces`` directory.
- Due to the removal of the `appdaemon` namespace, if anyone was manaully making a service call using it, will need to be updated
- ``binary`` is now a reserved keyword argument used when listening to MQTT events
- When using ``wildcard`` to listen for events within an app, only those used to subscribe to the broker can be used. so if using ``camera/#`` to subscribe to all camera related topics, AD will not recognise ``camera/front-door/#`` as a valid wildcard when listening for events; unless ``camera/front-door/#`` was used for subscription itself.
- Moved the local static folder for serving static files from `web` to `www`. If using ``web`` already, simply add it to `static_dirs` in the ``http`` component as described `here <https://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONFIGURE.html#configuring-the-http-component>`__

**Features**

**Breaking Changes**

- Time travel semantics have changed to support faster scheduling.
- ``plugin_started`` and ``plugin_stopped`` now go to the appropriate namespace for the plugin and are no longer global

**Breaking Changes**

- SSE Support has been removed
- Use of ha_key for authentication is deprecated and will be removed at some point. For now it will still work

While working through the upgrade it is strongly advised that you clear your browser cache and force the recompilation of all of your dashboards to flush out references to old icons. This can be done by manually removing the ``compiled`` subdirectory in ``conf_dir``, specifying ``recompile=1`` in the arguments to the dashboard, or setting the hadashboard option ``dash_compile_on_start`` to ``1``.
