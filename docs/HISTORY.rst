**Fixes**

-  Fix to give more information if initial connect to HA fails (but
   still avoid spamming logs too badly if it restarts)
-  Rename 'init' directory to 'scripts'
-  Tidy up docs

**Breaking Changes**

-  As a result of the repackaging for PIP3 installation, all apps must
   be edited to change the import statement of the api to
   ``import appdaemon.appapi as appapi``
-  Config must now be explicitly specfied with the -c option if you
   don't want it to pick a default file location
-  Logfile will no longer implicitly redirect to STDOUT if running
   without the -d flag, instead specify STDOUT in the config file or
   remove the logfile directive entirely
-  timezone is deprecated in favor of time\_zone but still works for now
