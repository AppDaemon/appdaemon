Writing AppDaemon Apps
=======================

AppDaemon (AD) is a loosely coupled, sandboxed, multi-threaded Python
execution environment for writing automation apps for `Home
Assistant <https://home-assistant.io/>`__, `MQTT <http://mqtt.org/>`__ event broker and other home automation software.

Examples
--------

Example apps that showcase most of these functions are available in the
AppDaemon `repository <https://github.com/home-assistant/appdaemon/tree/dev/conf/example_apps>`__

Anatomy of an App
-----------------

Actions in AppDaemon are performed by creating a piece of code
(essentially a Python Class) and then instantiating it as an Object one
or more times by configuring it as an App in the configuration file. The
App is given a chance to register itself for whatever events it wants to
subscribe to, and AppDaemon will then make calls back into the Object's
code when those events occur, allowing the App to respond to the event
with some kind of action.

The first step is to create a unique file within the apps directory (as
defined `here <INSTALL.html>`__). This file, is in fact, a Python
module, and is expected to contain one or more classes derived from a
supplied *AppDaemon class* or a *custom plugin*. For instance, hass support can be used
by importing from the supplied ``hassapi`` module. The start of an App might look like this:

.. code:: python

    import hassapi as hass

    class OutsideLights(hass.Hass):

For MQTT you would use the mqttapi module:

.. code:: python

    import mqttapi as mqtt

    class OutsideLights(mqtt.Mqtt):

When configured as an app in the config file (more on that later) the
lifecycle of the App begins. It will be instantiated as an object by
AppDaemon, and immediately, it will have a call made to its
``initialize()`` function - this function must appear as part of every
App:

.. code:: python

      def initialize(self):

The initialize function allows the App to register any callbacks it
might need for responding to state changes, and also any setup
activities. When the ``initialize()`` function returns, the App will be
dormant until any of its callbacks are activated.

There are several circumstances under which ``initialize()`` might be
called:

-  Initial start of AppDaemon
-  Following a change to the Class code
-  Following a change to the module parameters
-  Following initial configuration of an App
-  Following a change in the status of Daylight Saving Time
-  Following a restart of a plugin or underlying subsystem such as Home Assistant

In every case, the App is responsible for recreating any state it might
need as if it were the first time it was ever started. If
``initialize()`` is called, the App can safely assume that it is either
being loaded for the first time, or that all callbacks and timers have
been canceled. In either case, the App will need to recreate them.
Depending upon the application, it may be desirable for the App to
establish a state, such as whether or not a particular light is on,
within the ``initialize()`` function to ensure that everything is as
expected or to make immediate remedial action (e.g., turn off a light
that might have been left on by mistake when the App was restarted).

After the ``initialize()`` function is in place, the rest of the App
consists of functions that are called by the various callback
mechanisms, and any additional functions the user wants to add as part
of the program logic. Apps are able to subscribe to three main classes of
events:

-  Scheduled Events
-  State Change Events
-  Other Events

These, along with their various subscription calls and helper functions,
will be described in detail in later sections.

Optionally, a class can add a ``terminate()`` function. This function
will be called ahead of the reload to allow the class to perform any
tidy up that is necessary.

WARNING: Unlike other types of callback, calls to ``initialize()`` and
``terminate()`` are synchronous to AppDaemon's management code to ensure
that initialization or cleanup is completed before the App is loaded or
reloaded. This means that any significant delays in the ``terminate()``
code could have the effect of hanging AppDaemon for the duration of that
code - this should be avoided.

To wrap up this section, here is a complete functioning HASS App (with
comments):

.. code:: python

    import hassapi as hass
    import datetime

    # Declare Class
    class NightLight(hass.Hass):
      #initialize() function which will be called at startup and reload
      def initialize(self):
        # Create a time object for 7pm
        time = datetime.time(19, 00, 0)
        # Schedule a daily callback that will call run_daily() at 7pm every night
        self.run_daily(self.run_daily_callback, time)

       # Our callback function will be called by the scheduler every day at 7pm
      def run_daily_callback(self, kwargs):
        # Call to Home Assistant to turn the porch light on
        self.turn_on("light.porch")

To summarize - an App's lifecycle consists of being initialized, which
allows it to set one or more states and/or schedule callbacks. When
those callbacks are activated, the App will typically use one of the
Service Calling calls to effect some change to the devices of the system
and then wait for the next relevant state change. Finally, if the App is
reloaded, there is a call to its ``terminate()`` function if it exists.
That's all there is to it!

About the API
-------------

The implementation of the API is located in the AppDaemon class that
Apps are derived from. The code for the functions is therefore available
to the App simply by invoking the name of the function from the object
namespace using the ``self`` keyword, as in the above examples.
``self.turn_on()`` for example is just a method defined in the parent
class and made available to the child. This design decision was made to
simplify some of the implementation and hide passing of unnecessary
variables during the API invocation.

Configuration of Apps
---------------------

Apps are configured by specifying new sections in an app configuration
file. The App configuration files exist under the apps directory and can be called anything as long as they end in ``.yaml``. You can have one single file for configuration of all apps, or break it down to have one ``yaml`` file per App, or anything in between. Coupled with the fact that you can have any number of subdirectories for apps and ``yaml`` files, this gives you the flexibility to structure your apps as you see fit.
It should also be noted that a "dot" ``.`` is not allowed in the app name.

The entry for an individual App within a ``yaml`` file is simply a dictionary entry naming the App, with subfields to supply various parameters. The name of the section is the name the App is referred to within the system in log files etc. and must be unique.

To configure a new App you need a minimum of two directives:

-  ``module`` - the name of the module (without the ``.py``) that
   contains the class to be used for this App
-  ``class`` - the name of the class as defined within the module for
   the App's code

Although the section/App name must be unique, it is possible to re-use a
class as many times as you want, and conversely to put as many classes
in a module as you want. A sample definition for a new App might look as
follows:

.. code:: yaml

    newapp:
      module: new
      class: NewApp

When AppDaemon sees the following configuration, it will expect to find a
class called ``NewApp`` defined in a module called ``new.py`` in the
apps subdirectory. Apps can be placed at the root of the Apps directory
or within a subdirectory, an arbitrary depth down - wherever the App is,
as long as it is in some subdirectory of the Apps dir, or in the Apps
dir itself, AppDaemon will find it. There is no need to include
information about the path, just the name of the file itself (without
the ``.py``) is sufficient. If names in the subdirectories overlap,
AppDir will pick one of them but the exact choice it will make is
undefined.
When starting the system for the first time or when reloading an App or
Module, the system will log the fact in its main log. It is often the
case that there is a problem with the class, maybe a syntax error or
some other problem. If that is the case, details will be output to the
error log allowing the user to remedy the problem and reload.

In general, the user should always keep an eye on the error log - system
errors will be logged to the main log, any errors that are the responsibility
of the user, e.g. that come from app code will be found in the error log.


Steps to writing an App
-----------------------

1. Create the code in a new or shared module by deriving a class from
   AppDaemon, add required callbacks and code
2. Add the App to the app configuration file
3. There is no number 3

Reloading Modules and Classes
-----------------------------

Reloading of modules is automatic. When the system spots a change in a
module, it will automatically reload and recompile the module. It will
also figure out which Apps were using that Module and restart them,
causing their ``terminate()`` functions to be called if they exist, all
of their existing callbacks to be cleared, and their ``initialize()``
function to be called.

The same is true if changes are made to an App's configuration -
changing the class, or arguments (see later) will cause that App to be
reloaded in the same way. The system is also capable of detecting if a
new App has been added, or if one has been removed, and it will act
appropriately, starting the new App immediately and removing all
callbacks for the removed App.

The suggested order for creating a new App is to first add the apps.yaml entry
then the module code and work until it compiles cleanly. A good workflow is to
continuously monitor the error file (using ``tail -f`` on Linux for
instance) to ensure that errors are seen and can be remedied.

Passing Arguments to Apps
-------------------------

There wouldn't be much point in being able to run multiple versions of
an App if there wasn't some way to instruct them to do something
different. For this reason, it is possible to pass any required arguments
to an App, which are then made available to the object at runtime. The
arguments themselves can be called anything (apart from ``module`` or
``class``) and are simply added into the section after the 2 mandatory
directives like so:

.. code:: yaml

    MyApp:
      module: myapp
      class: MyApp
      param1: spam
      param2: eggs

Within the Apps code, the 2 parameters (as well as the module and class)
are available as a dictionary called ``args``, and accessed as follows:

.. code:: python

    param1 = self.args["param1"]
    param2 = self.args["param2"]

A use case for this might be an App that detects motion and turns on a
light. If you have 3 places you want to run this, rather than hardcoding
this into 3 separate Apps, you need only code a single App and
instantiate it 3 times with different arguments. It might look something
like this:

.. code:: yaml

    downstairs_motion_light:
      module: motion_light
      class: MotionLight
      sensor: binary_sensor.downstairs_hall
      light: light.downstairs_hall
    upstairs_motion_light:
      module: motion_light
      class: MotionLight
      sensor: binary_sensor.upstairs_hall
      light: light.upstairs_hall
    garage_motion_light:
      module: motion_light
      class: MotionLight
      sensor: binary_sensor.garage
      light: light.garage

Apps can use arbitrarily complex structures within arguments, e.g.:

.. code:: yaml

    entities:
      - entity1
      - entity2
      - entity3

Which can be accessed as a list in python with:

.. code:: python

    for entity in self.args["entities"]:
      do some stuff

Also, this opens the door to really complex parameter structures if
required:

.. code:: python

    sensors:
      sensor1:
        type:thermometer
        warning_level: 30
        units: degrees
      sensor2:
        type:moisture
        warning_level: 100
        units: %

It is also possible to get some constants like the app directory within apps. This can be accessed using the attribute ``self.app_dir``

Secrets
~~~~~~~

AppDaemon supports the ability to pass sensitive arguments to apps, via the use of secrets in the main or app config file. This will allow separate storage of sensitive information such as passwords. For this to work, AppDaemon expects to find a file called ``secrets.yaml`` in the configuration directory, or a named file introduced by the top level ``secrets:`` section. The file should be a simple list of all the secrets. The secrets can be referred to using a ``!secret`` tag in the ``apps.yaml`` file.

An example ``secrets.yaml`` might look like this:

.. code:: yaml

    application_api_key: ABCDEFG

The secrets can then be referred to in the ``apps.yaml`` file as follows:

.. code:: yaml

    appname:
      class: AppClass
      module: appmodule
      application_api_key: !secret application_api_key

In the App, the api_key can be accessed like every other argument the App can access.

Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If not wanting to use the secrets as above, AppDaemon also supports the ability to pass sensitive arguments to apps, via the use of environment variables in the main or app config file. This will allow separate storage of sensitive information such as passwords, within the os's environment variables. The varibales can be referred to using a ``!env_var`` tag in the ``apps.yaml`` file.

An example using the os's time zone for AD:

.. code:: yaml

    appdaemon:
      time_zone: !env_var TZ
      latitude: !env_var LAT
      longitude: !env_var LONG

The variables can also be referred to in the ``apps.yaml`` file as follows:

.. code:: yaml

    appname:
      class: AppClass
      module: appmodule
      application_api_key: !env_var application_api_key

In the App, the api_key can be accessed like every other argument the App can access.

App Dependencies
----------------

It is possible for apps to be dependant upon other apps. Some
examples where this might be the case are:

-  A global App that defines constants for use in other apps
-  An App that provides a service for other modules, e.g., a TTS App

In these cases, when changes are made to one of these apps, we also
want the apps that depend upon them to be reloaded. Furthermore, we
also want to guarantee that they are loaded in order so that the apps
depended upon by other modules are loaded first.

AppDaemon fully supports this through the use of the dependency
directive in the App configuration. Using this directive, each App
identifies other apps that it depends upon. The dependency directive
will identify the name of the App it cares about, and AppDaemon
will see to it that the dependency is loaded before the App depending
on it, and that the dependent App will be reloaded if it changes.

For example, an App ``Consumer``, uses another App ``Sound`` to play
sound files. ``Sound`` in turn uses ``Global`` to store some global
values. We can represent these dependencies as follows:

.. code:: yaml

    Global:
      module: global
      class: Global

    Sound
      module: sound
      class: Sound
      dependencies: Global

    Consumer:
      module: sound
      class: Sound
      dependencies: Sound

It is also possible to have multiple dependencies, added as a yaml list

.. code:: yaml

    Consumer:
      module: sound
      class: Sound
      dependencies:
        - Sound
        - Global

AppDaemon will write errors to the log if a dependency is missing and it
will also detect circular dependencies.

Dependencies can also be set using the ``register_dependency()`` api call.

App Loading Priority
--------------------

It is possible to influence the loading order of Apps using the dependency system. To add a loading priority to an App, simply add a ``priority`` entry to its parameters. e.g.:

.. code:: yaml

    downstairs_motion_light:
      module: motion_light
      class: MotionLight
      sensor: binary_sensor.downstairs_hall
      light: light.downstairs_hall
      priority: 10


Priorities can be any number you like, and can be float values if required, the lower the number, the higher the priority. AppDaemon will load any modules with a priority in the order specified.

For modules with no priority specified, the priority is assumed to be ``50``. It is, therefore, possible to cause modules to be loaded before and after modules with no priority.

The priority system is complementary to the dependency system, although they are trying to solve different problems. Dependencies should be used when an App literally depends upon another, for instance, it is using variables stored in it with the ``get_app()`` call. Priorities should be used when an App does some setup for other apps but doesn't provide variables or code for the dependent App. An example of this might be an App that sets up some sensors in Home Assistant, or sets some switch or input_slider to a specific value. It may be necessary for that setup to be performed before other apps are started, but there is no requirement to reload those apps if the first App changes.

To accommodate both systems, dependency trees are assigned priorities in the range 50 - 51, again allowing apps to set priorities such that they will be loaded before or after specific sets of dependent apps.

Note that apps that are dependent upon other apps, and apps that are depended upon by other apps will ignore any priority setting in their configuration.

App Log
-------

Starting from AD 4.0, it is now possible to determine which log as declared by the user, will be used by Apps by default when using the ``self.log()`` within the App; this can be very useful for debugging purposes. This is done by simply adding the ``log:`` directive entry, to its parameters. e.g.:

.. code:: yaml

    downstairs_motion_light:
      module: motion_light
      class: MotionLight
      sensor: binary_sensor.downstairs_hall
      light: light.downstairs_hall
      log: lights_log


By declaring the above, each time the function ``self.log()`` is used within the App, the log entry is sent to the user defined ``lights_log``. It is also possible to write to another log, within the same App if need be. This is done using the function ``self.log(text, log='main_log')``. Without using any of the aforementioned log capabilities, all logs from apps by default will be sent to the ``main_log``.

Global Module Dependencies
--------------------------

The previously described dependencies and load order have all been at the App level. It is however, sometimes convenient to have global modules that have no apps in them that nonetheless require dependency tracking. For instance, a global module might have a number of useful variables in it. When they change, a number of apps may need to be restarted. To configure this dependency tracking, it is first necessary to define which modules are going to be tracked. This is done in any apps.yaml file, although it should only be in one place. We use the ``global_modules`` directive:

.. code:: yaml

    global_modules: global

This means that the file ``globals.py`` anywhere with in the apps directory hierarchy is marked as a global module. Any App may simply import ``globals`` and use its variables and functions. Marking multiple modules as global can be achieved using standard YAML list format:

.. code:: yaml

    global_modules:
      - global1
      - global2
      - global3

Once we have marked the global modules, the next step is to configure any apps that are dependant upon them. This is done by adding a ``global_dependencies`` field to the App description, e.g.:

.. code:: yaml

    app1:
      class: App
      module: app
      global_dependencies: global

Or for multiple dependencies:

.. code:: yaml

    app1:
      class: App
      module: app
      global_dependencies:
        - global1
        - global2

With this in place, whenever a global module changes that apps depend upon, all dependent apps will be reloaded. This also works well with the App level dependencies. If a change to a global module forces an App to reload that other apps are dependant upon, the dependant apps will also be reloaded in sequence.

Plugin Reloads
--------------

When a plugin reloads e.g., due to the underlying system restarting, or a network issue, AppDaemon's default assumption is that all apps could potentially be dependant on that system, and it will force a restart of every App. It is possible to modify this behavior at the individual App level, using the ``plugin`` parameter in apps.yaml. Specifying a specific plugin or list of plugins will force the App to reload after the named plugin restarts.

For a simple AppDaemon install, the appdaemon.yaml file might look something like this:

.. code:: yaml

     appdaemon:
       threads: 10
       plugins:
         HASS:
           type: hass
           ha_url: <some_url>
           ha_key: <some_key>

In this setup, there is only one plugin, and it is called ``HASS`` - this will be the case for most AppDaemon users.

To make an App explicitly reload when only this plugin and no other is restarted (e.g., in the case when HASS restarts or when AppDaemon loses connectivity to HASS), use the ``plugin`` parameter like so:

.. code:: yaml

    appname:
        module: some_module
        class: some_class
        plugin: HASS

If you have more than one plugin, you can make an App dependent on more than one plugin by specifying a YAML list:

.. code:: yaml

    appname:
        module: some_module
        class: some_class
        plugin:
          - HASS
          - OTHERPLUGIN

If you want to prevent the App from reloading at all, just set the ``plugin`` parameter to some value that doesn't match any plugin name, e.g.:

.. code:: yaml

    appname:
        module: some_module
        class: some_class
        plugin: NONE

Note, that this only effects reloading at plugin restart time:

- apps will be reloaded if the module they use changes
- apps will be reloaded if their apps.yaml changes
- apps will be reloaded when a change to or from DST (Daylight Saving Time) occurs
- apps will be reloaded if an App they depend upon is reloaded as part of a plugin restart
- apps will be reloaded if changes are made to a global module that they depend upon

Callback Constraints
--------------------

Callback constraints are a feature of AppDaemon that removes the need
for repetition of some common coding checks. Many Apps will wish to
process their callbacks only when certain conditions are met, e.g.,
someone is home, and it's after sunset. These kinds of conditions crop
up a lot, and use of callback constraints can significantly simplify the
logic required within callbacks.

Put simply, callback constraints are one or more conditions on callback
execution that can be applied to an individual App. App's callbacks
will only be executed if all of the constraints are met. If a constraint
is absent, it will not be checked for.

For example, a time callback constraint can be added to an App by
adding a parameter to its configuration like this:

.. code:: yaml

    some_app:
      module: some_module
      class: SomeClass
      constrain_start_time: sunrise
      constrain_end_time: sunset

Now, although the ``initialize()`` function will be called for
SomeClass, and it will have a chance to register as many callbacks as it
desires, none of the callbacks will execute, in this case, unless it is between sunrise and sunset.

An App can have as many or as few constraints as are required. When more than one
constraint is present, they must all evaluate to true to allow the
callbacks to be called. Constraints becoming true are not an event in
their own right, but if they are all true at a point in time, the next
callback that would otherwise be blocked due to constraint failure
will now be called. Similarly, if one of the constraints becomes false,
the next callback that would otherwise have been called will be blocked.

AppDaemon Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AppDaemon itself supplies the time constraint:

time
^^^^

The time constraint consists of 2 variables, ``constrain_start_time``
and ``constrain_end_time``. Callbacks will only be executed if the
current time is between the start and end times.

- If both are absent no time constraint will exist
- If only start is present, end will default to 1 second before midnight
- If only end is present, start will default to midnight

The times are specified in a string format with one of the following
formats:

- HH:MM:SS - the time in Hours Minutes and Seconds, 24 hour format.
- ``sunrise``\ \|\ ``sunset`` [+\|- HH:MM:SS]- time of the next sunrise or sunset with an optional positive or negative offset in Hours Minutes and seconds

The time based constraint system correctly interprets start and end
times that span midnight.

.. code:: yaml

    # Run between 8am and 10pm
    constrain_start_time: "08:00:00"
    constrain_end_time: "22:00:00"
    # Run between sunrise and sunset
    constrain_start_time: sunrise
    constrain_end_time: sunset
    # Run between 45 minutes before sunset and 45 minutes after sunrise the next day
    constrain_start_time: sunset - 00:45:00
    constrain_end_time: sunrise + 00:45:00


days
^^^^

The day constraint consists of as list of days for which the callbacks
will fire, e.g.,

.. code:: yaml

    constrain_days: mon,tue,wed

Other constraints may be supplied by the plugin in use.

HASS Plugin Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HASS plugin supplies several additional different types of constraints:

-  input\_boolean
-  input\_select
-  presence
-  time (see `AppDaemon Constraints <APPGUIDE.html#time>`__)

They are described individually below.

input\_boolean
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the input\_boolean constraint prevents callbacks unless the
specified input\_boolean is set to ``on``. This is useful to allow certain
Apps to be turned on and off from the user interface. For example:

.. code:: yaml

    some_app:
      module: some_module
      class: SomeClass
      constrain_input_boolean: input_boolean.enable_motion_detection

If you want to reverse the logic so the constraint is only called when
the input\_boolean is off, use the optional state parameter by appending,
``off`` to the argument, e.g.:

.. code:: yaml

    some_app:
      module: some_module
      class: SomeClass
      constrain_input_boolean: input_boolean.enable_motion_detection,off

input\_select
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The input\_select constraint prevents callbacks unless the specified
input\_select is set to one or more of the nominated (comma separated)
values. This is useful to allow certain Apps to be turned on and off
according to some flag, e.g., a house mode flag.

.. code:: yaml

    # Single value
    constrain_input_select: input_select.house_mode,Day
    # or multiple values
    constrain_input_select: input_select.house_mode,Day,Evening,Night

presence
^^^^^^^^

The presence constraint will constrain based on presence of device
trackers. It takes 3 possible values:

- ``noone`` - only allow callback execution when no one is home
- ``anyone`` - only allow callback execution when one or more person is home
- ``everyone`` - only allow callback execution when everyone is home

.. code:: yaml

    constrain_presence: anyone
    # or
    constrain_presence: everyone
    # or
    constrain_presence: noone

Callback constraints can also be applied to individual callbacks within
Apps, see later for more details.

person
^^^^^^^^

The person constraint will constrain based on presence of person entities
trackers. It takes 3 possible values:

- ``noone`` - only allow callback execution when no one is home
- ``anyone`` - only allow callback execution when one or more person is home
- ``everyone`` - only allow callback execution when everyone is home

.. code:: yaml

    constrain_person: anyone
    # or
    constrain_person: everyone
    # or
    constrain_person: noone

Callback constraints can also be applied to individual callbacks within
Apps, see later for more details.

AppDaemon and Threading
-----------------------

AppDaemon is multi-threaded. This means that any time code within an App
is executed, it is executed by one of many threads. This is generally
not a particularly important consideration for this application; in
general, the execution time of callbacks is expected to be far quicker
than the frequency of events causing them. By default, AppDaemon protects Apps from threading considerations by pinning each App to a specific thread, which means it is not possible for an App to be running in more than one thread at a time. In extremely busy systems this may cause a reduction in performance but this is unlikely.

By default, each App gets its own unique thread to run in. This is generally more threads than are required but it prevents badly behaved apps from blocking other apps pinned to the same thread. This organization can be optimized to use fewer threads if desired by using some of the advanced options below. AppDaemon will dynamically manage the threads for you, creating enough for each App, and adding threads over the lifetime of AppDaemon if new apps are added, to guarantee they all get their own thread.

For most users, threading should be left at the defaults, and things will behave sensibly. If however, you understand concurrency, locking, and re-entrant code, read on for some additional advanced options.

Thread Hygiene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An additional caveat of a threaded worker pool environment is that it is
the expectation that none of the callbacks tie threads up for a
significant amount of time. To do so would eventually lead to thread
exhaustion, which would make the system run behind events. No events
would be lost as they would be queued, but callbacks would be delayed,
which is a bad thing.

Given the above, **NEVER** use Python's ``time.sleep()`` if you want to
perform an operation some time in the future, as this will tie up a
thread for the period of the sleep. Instead, use the scheduler's
``run_in()`` function which will allow you to delay without blocking any
threads.

Disabling App Pinning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you know what you are doing and understand the risks, you can disable AppDaemon's App Pinning, partially or totally. AppDaemon gives you a huge amount of control, allowing you to enable or disable pinning of individual apps, all apps of a certain class, or even down to the callback level. AppDaemon also lets you explicitly choose which thread apps or callbacks run on, resulting in extremely fine-grained control.

If you disable App pinning, you will start with a default number of 10 threads, but this can be modified with the ``total_threads`` setting in appdaemon.yaml.

To disable App Pinning globally within AppDaemon set the AppDaemon directive ``pin_apps`` to ``false`` within the AppDaemon.yaml file and App pinning will be disabled for all apps. At this point, it is possible for different pieces of
code within the App to be executed concurrently, so some care may be necessary if different callbacks, for instance, inspect and change shared
variables. This is a fairly standard caveat with concurrent programming, and AppDaemon supplies a simple locking mechanism to help avoid this.

Simple Callback Level Locking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The real issue here is that callbacks in an unpinned App can be called at the same time, and even have multiple threads running through them at the same time. To add locking and avoid this, AppDaemon supplies a decorator called ``ad.app_lock``. If you use this with any callbacks that manipulate instance variables, you will ensure that there will only be one thread accessing the variables at one time.

Consider the following App which schedules 1000 callbacks all to run at the exact same time, and manipulate the value of ``self.important_var``:

.. code:: python

    import hassapi as hass
    import datetime

    class Locking(hass.Hass):

        def initialize(self):
            self.important_var = 0

            now = datetime.datetime.now()
            target = now + datetime.timedelta(seconds=2)
            for i in range (1000):
                self.run_at(self.hass_cb, target)

        def hass_cb(self, kwargs):
            self.important_var += 1
            self.log(self.important_var)

As it is, it will result in unexpected results because ``self.important_var`` can be manipulated by multiple threads at once - for instance, a thread could get the value, add one to it and be just about to write it when another thread jumps in with a different value, which is immediately overwritten. Indeed, when this is run, the output shows just that:

.. code::

    2018-11-04 16:07:01.615683 INFO lock: 981

    2018-11-04 16:07:01.623519 INFO lock: 999

However, if we add the decorator to the callback function like so:

.. code:: python

    import hassapi as hass
    import datetime

    class Locking(hass.Hass):

        def initialize(self):
            self.important_var = 0

            now = datetime.datetime.now()
            target = now + datetime.timedelta(seconds=2)
            for i in range (1000):
                self.run_at(self.hass_cb, target)

        @ad.app_lock
        def hass_cb(self, kwargs):
            self.important_var += 1
            self.log(self.important_var)


The result is what we would hope for since self.important_var is only being accessed by one thread at a time:

.. code::

    2018-11-04 16:08:54.545795 INFO lock: 981

    2018-11-04 16:08:54.553890 INFO lock: 1000

The above scenario is only an issue when thread pinning is disabled. However, another issue with threading arises when apps call each other and modify variables using the ``get_app()`` call, regardless of whether or not apps are pinned. If a particular App is called at the same time from several different apps using ``get_app()``, the App in question will potentially be running on many threads at the same time, and any local resources such as instance variables that are updated could be corrupted. ``@ad.app_lock`` will also work well to address this situation, if it is applied to the function in the App that is being called. This will force the function to lock using the local lock of the App being called and will enable thread-safe operation.

app1:

.. code:: python

    my_app = get_app("app2")
    my_app.myfunction()

app2:

.. code:: python

    @ad.app_lock
    def my_function()
        self.variable + = 1

Global Locking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The above style of locking works well for the protection of variables within a single App and across apps using ``get_app()``. However, another area where threading might be of concern is if apps are accessing and modifying the dictionary of the global variables which has no locking.

The solution is a global locking decorator called ``@ad.global_lock``:

.. code:: python

    @ad.global_lock
    def so_something_with_global_vars()
        self.global_vars += 1

Per-App Pinning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Individual apps can be set to override the global AppDaemon setting for App Pinning by use of the ``pin_app`` directive in apps.yaml:

.. code:: yaml

    module: test
    class: Test
    pin_app: false

So if for instance, AppDaemon is set to globally pin apps, the above example will override that and make the App unpinned.

Likewise, if the default is to globally unpin apps, setting ``pin_app`` to ``true`` will pin the App.

In addition to controlling pinning, it is also possible to specify the exact thread an App's callbacks will run on, using the ``pin_thread`` directive:

.. code:: yaml

    module: test
    class: Test
    pin_app: true
    pin_thread: 6

This will result in all callbacks for this App being run by thread 6. The ``pin_thread`` directive will be ignored if ``pin_app`` is set to false, or if ``pin_app`` is not specified and the global setting is to not pin apps.

Per Class Pinning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to per-App pinning, it is possible to pin an entire class so that all apps running that code can be pinned or not. This is achieved using an API call, usually in the ``initialize()`` function that will control whether or not the App is pinned, which will also apply to all apps of the same type since they share the code. Pinning can be enabled or disabled, and thread selected using the pinning API calls:

- ``set_app_pin()``
- ``get_app_pin()``
- ``set_pin_thread()``
- ``get_pin_thread()``

These API calls are dynamic, so it is possible to pin and unpin an App as required as well as select the thread it will run on at any point in the Apps lifetime. Callbacks for the scheduler, events or state changes will inherit the values currently set at the time the callback is registered:

.. code:: python

    # Turn on app pinning
    self.set_app_pin(True)
    # Select a thread
    self.set_pin_thread(5)
    # Set a scheduler callback for an hour hence
    self.run_in(my_callback, 3600)
    # Change the thread
    self.set_pin_thread(3)
    # Set a scheduler callback for 2 hours hence
    self.run_in(my_callback, 7200)

The code above will result in 2 callbacks, the first will run on thread 5, the second will run on thread 3.

Per Callback Pinning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Per Class Pinning described above, despite its dynamic nature is really intended to be a set and forget setup activity in the apps ``initialize()`` function. For more dynamic use, it is possible to set the pinning and thread at the callback level, using the ``pin`` and ``pin_thread`` parameters to scheduler calls and ``listen_state()`` and ``listen_event()``. These parameters will override the default settings for the App as set in apps.yaml or via the API calls above, but just for the callback in question.

.. code:: python

    # Turn off app pinning
    self.set_app_pin(True)
    # Select a thread
    self.set_pin_thread(5)
    # Set a scheduler callback for an hour hence
    self.run_in(my_callback, 3600, pin=False)

The above callback will not be pinned.

.. code:: python

    # Turn off app pinning
    set_app_pin(True)
    # Select a thread
    set_pin_thread(5)
    # Set a scheduler callback for an hour hence
    run_in(my_callback, 3600, pin_thread=9)

The above callback will be run on thread 9, overriding the call to ``set_pin_thread()``.

.. code:: python

    # Set a scheduler callback for an hour hence
    run_in(my_callback, 3600, pin=True)

The above code is an edge case, if the global or App default is set to not pin. In this case, there won't be an obvious thread to use since it isn't specified, so the callback will default to run on thread 0.

Restricting Threads for Pinned Apps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For some usages in mixed pinned and non-pinned environments, it may be desirable to reserve a block of thread specifically for pinned apps. This can be achieved by setting the ``pin_threads`` directive in AppDamon.yaml:

.. code:: YAML

    pin_threads: 5

In the above example, 5 threads will be reserved for pinned apps, meaning that pinned apps will only run on threads 0 - 4, and will be distributed among them evenly. If the system has 10 threads total, threads 5 - 9 will have no pinned apps running on them, representing spare capacity. In order to utilize the spare threads, you can code apps to explicitly run on them, or set them in the apps.yaml, perhaps reserving threads for specific high priority apps, while the rest of the apps share the lower priority threads. Another way to manage this is via the selection of an appropriate scheduler algorithm.

``pin_threads`` will default to the actual number of threads, if App pinning is turned on globally, and it will default to 0 if App pinning is turned off globally. In a mixed setting, if you have any unpinned apps at all you must ensure that ``pin_threads`` is set to a value less than threads.

Scheduler Algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When apps are pinned, there is no choice necessary as to which thread will run a given callback. It will either be selected by AppDaemon, or explicitly specified by the user for each App. For the remainder of unpinned Apps, AppDaemon must make a choice as to which thread to use, in an attempt to keep the load balanced. There is a choice of 3 strategies, set by the ``load_distribution`` directive in appdaemon.yaml:

- ``roundrobin`` (default) - distribute callbacks to threads in a sequential fashion, one thread after another, starting at the beginning when all threads have had their turn. Round Robin scheduling will honor the ``pin_threads`` directive and only use threads not reserved for pinned apps.
- ``random`` - distribute callbacks to available threads in a random fashion. Random will also honor the ``pin_threads`` directive
- ``load`` - distribute callbacks to the least busy threads (measured by their Q size). Since Load based scheduling is dynamically responding to load, it will take all threads into consideration, including those reserved for pinned apps.

For example:

.. code:: YAML

    load_distribution: random

A Final Thought on Threading and Pinning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although pinning and scheduling has been thoroughly tested, in current real-world applications for AppDaemon, very few of these considerations matter, since in most cases AppDaemon will be able to respond to a callback immediately, and it is unlikely that any significant scheduler queueing will occur unless there are problems with apps blocking threads. At the rate that most people are using AppDaemon, events come in a few times a second, and modern hardware can usually handle the load pretty easily. The considerations above will start to matter more when event rates become a lot faster, by at least an order of magnitude. That is now a possibility with the recent upgrade to the scheduler allowing sub-second tick times, so the ability to lock and pin apps were added in anticipation of new applications for AppDaemon that may require more robust management of apps and much higher event rates.

ASYNC Apps
----------

Note: This is an advanced feature and should only be used if you understand the usage and implications of async programming
in Python. If you do not, then the previously described threaded model of apps is much safer and easier to work with.

AppDaemon supports the use of async libraries from within apps as well as allowing a partial or complete async programming
model. Callback functions can be converted into coroutines by using the `async` keyword during their declaration.
AppDaemon will automatically detect all the App's coroutines and will schedule their execution on the main async loop.
This also works for ``initialize()`` and ``terminate()``. Apps can be a mix of `sync` and `async` callbacks as desired.
A fully async app might look like this:

.. code:: PYTHON

    import hassapi as hass

    class AsyncApp(hass.Hass):

        async def initialize(self):
            # Maybe access an async library to initialize something
            self.run_in(self.hass_cb, 10)

        async def my_function(self):
            # More async stuff here

        async def hass_cb(self, kwargs):
            # do some async stuff

            # Sleeps are perfectly acceptable
            await self.sleep(10)

            # Call another coroutine
            await my_function()

When writing ASYNC apps, please be aware that most of the methods available in ADAPI (generally referenced as ``self.method_name()`` in an app) are async methods. While these coroutines are automatically turned into a ``future`` for you, if you intend to use the data they return you'll need to ``await`` them.

This will not give the expected result:

.. code:: PYTHON

    async def some_method(self):
        handle = self.run_in(self.cb, 30)

This, however, will:

.. code:: PYTHON

    async def some_method(self):
        handle = await self.run_in(self.cb, 30)

If you do not need to use the return result of the method, and you do not need to know that it has completed before executing the next line of your code, then you do not need to ``await`` the method.

ASYNC Advantages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Programming using async constructs can seem natural to advanced users who have used it before, and in some cases, can provide performance benefits depending on the exact nature of the task.
- Some external libraries are designed to be used in an async environment, and prior to AppDaemon async support it was not possible to make use of such libraries.
- Scheduling heavily concurrent tasks is very easy using async
- Using ``sleep()`` in async apps is not harmful to the overall performance of AppDaemon as it is in regular sync apps

ASYNC Caveats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AppDaemon implementation of ASYNC apps utilizes the same loop as the AppDaemon core. This means that a badly behaved
app will not just tie up an individual app; it can potentially tie up all other apps, and the internals of AppDaemon.
For this reason, it is recommended that only experienced users create apps with this model.


ASYNC Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~

AppDaemon supplies a number of helper functions to make things a little easier:

Creating Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For additional multitasking, Apps are fully able to create tasks or futures, however, the app has the responsibility to
manage them. In particular, any created tasks or futures must be completed or actively canceled when the app is terminated
or reloaded. If this is not the case, the code will not reload correctly due to Pyhton's garbage collection strategy. To assist
with this, AppDaemon has a ``create_task()`` call, which returns a future. Tasks created in this way can be manipulated as
desired, however, AppDaemon keeps track of them and will automatically cancel any outstanding futures if the app terminates
or reloads. For this reason, AppDaemon's ``create_task()`` is the recommended way of doing this.

Use of Executors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A standard pattern for running I/O intensive tasks such as file or network access in the async programming model is to
use executor threads for these types of activities. AppDaemon supplies the ``run_in_executor()`` function to facilitate
this, which uses a predefined thread-pool for execution. As mentioned above, holding up the loop with any blocking activity
is harmful not only to the app but all other apps and AppDaemon's internals, so always use an executor for any function
that may require it.

Sleeping
^^^^^^^^

Sleeping in Apps is perfectly fine using the async model. For this purpose, AppDaemon provides the ``sleep()`` function.
If this function is used in a non-async callback, it will raise an exception.

ASYNC Threading Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Bear in mind, that although the async programming model is single threaded, in an event-driven environment such as AppDaemon, concurrency is still possible, whereas in the pinned threading model it is eliminated. This may lead to requirements to lock data structures in async apps.
- By default, AppDaemon creates a thread for each App (unless you are managing the threads yourself). For a fully async app, the thread will be created but never used.
- If you have a 100% async environment, you can prevent the creation of any threads by setting ``total_threads: 0`` in ``appdaemon.yaml``


State Operations
----------------

AppDaemon maintains a master state list segmented by namespace. As plugins notify state changes, AppDaemon listens and stores the updated state locally.

The MQTT plugin does not use state at all, and it relies on events to trigger actions, whereas the Home Assistant plugin makes extensive use of state.

A note on Home Assistant State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

State within Home Assistant is stored as a collection of dictionaries,
one for each entity. Each entity's dictionary will have some common
fields and a number of entity type-specific fields. The state for an
entity will always have the attributes:

-  ``last_updated``
-  ``last_changed``
-  ``state``

Any other attributes such as brightness for a lamp will only be present
if the entity supports them, and will be stored in a sub-dictionary
called ``attributes``. When specifying these optional attributes in the
``get_state()`` call, no special distinction is required between the
main attributes and the optional ones - ``get_state()`` will figure it
out for you.

Also, bear in mind that some attributes such as brightness for a light,
will not be present when the light is off.

In most cases, the attribute ``state`` has the most important value in
it, e.g., for a light or switch this will be ``on`` or ``off``, for a
sensor it will be the value of that sensor. Many of the AppDaemon API
calls and callbacks will implicitly return the value of state unless
told to do otherwise.

Although the use of ``get_state()`` (below) is still supported, as of
AppDaemon 2.0.9 it is possible to access HASS state directly as an
attribute of the App itself, under the ``entities`` attribute.

For instance, to access the state of a binary sensor, you could use:

.. code:: python

    sensor_state = self.entities.binary_sensor.downstairs_sensor.state

Similarly, accessing any of the entity attributes is also possible:

.. code:: python

    name = self.entities.binary_sensor.downstairs_sensor.attributes.friendly_name

About Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A large proportion of home automation revolves around waiting for
something to happen and then reacting to it; a light level drops, the
sun rises, a door opens, etc. Plugins keep track of every state
change that occurs within the system, and they streams that information to
AppDaemon almost immediately.

A single App however usually doesn't care about the majority of
state changes going on in the system; Apps usually care about something
very specific, like a specific sensor or light. Apps need a way to be
notified when a state change happens that they care about, and be able
to ignore the rest. They do this by registering callbacks. A
callback allows the App to describe exactly what it is interested in,
and tells AppDaemon to make a call into its code in a specific place to
be able to react to it - this is a very familiar concept to anyone
familiar with event-based programming.

There are 3 types of callbacks within AppDaemon:

-  State Callbacks - react to a change in state
-  Scheduler Callbacks - react to a specific time or interval
-  Event Callbacks - react to specific Home Assistant and AppDaemon
   events.

All callbacks allow users to specify additional parameters to be
handed to the callback via the standard Python ``**kwargs`` mechanism
for greater flexibility, these additional arguments are handed to the
callback as a standard Python dictionary,

About Registering Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each of the various types of callback have their own function or
functions for registering the callback:

-  ``listen_state()`` for state callbacks
-  Various scheduler calls such as ``run_once()`` for scheduling
   callbacks
-  ``listen_event()`` for event callbacks.

Each type of callback shares a number of common mechanisms that increase
flexibility.

Callback Level Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When registering a callback, you can add constraints identical to the
Application level constraints described earlier. The difference is that
a constraint applied to an individual callback only affects that
callback and no other. The constraints are applied by adding Python
keyword-value style arguments after the positional arguments. The
parameters themselves are named identically to the previously described
constraints and have identical functionality. For instance, adding:

.. code:: python

    constrain_presence="everyone"

to a HASS callback registration will ensure that the callback is only run if
the callback conditions are met, and in addition everyone is present
although any other callbacks might run whenever their event fires if
they have no constraints.

For example:

.. code:: python

    self.listen_state(self.motion, "binary_sensor.drive", constrain_presence="everyone")

User Arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any callback can allow the App creator to pass through
arbitrary keyword arguments that will be presented to the callback when
it is run. The arguments are added after the positional parameters, just
like the constraints. The only restriction is that they cannot be the
same as any constraint name for obvious reasons. For example, to pass
the parameter ``arg1 = "home assistant"`` through to a callback you
would register a callback as follows:

.. code:: python

    self.listen_state(self.motion, "binary_sensor.drive", arg1="home assistant")

Then in the callback it is presented back to the function as a
dictionary and you could use it as follows:

.. code:: python

    def motion(self, entity, attribute, old, new, kwargs):
        self.log("Arg1 is {}".format(kwargs["arg1"]))

State Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AppDaemons's state callbacks allow an App to listen to a wide variety of
events, from every state change in the system, right down to a change of
a single attribute of a particular entity. Setting up a callback is done
using a single API call ``listen_state()`` which takes various arguments
to allow it to do all of the above. Apps can register as many or as few
callbacks as they want.

About State Callback Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When calling back into the App, the App must provide a class function
with a known signature for AppDaemon to call. The callback will provide
various information to the function to enable the function to respond
appropriately. For state callbacks, a class defined callback function
should look like this:

.. code:: python

      def my_callback(self, entity, attribute, old, new, kwargs):
        <do some useful work here>

You can call the function whatever you like - you will reference it in
the ``listen_state()`` call, and you can create as many callback
functions as you need.

The parameters have the following meanings:

self
^^^^

A standard Python object reference.

entity
^^^^^^

Name of the entity the callback was requested for or ``None``.

attribute
^^^^^^^^^

Name of the attribute the callback was requested for or ``None``.

old
^^^

The value of the state before the state change.

new
^^^

The value of the state after the state change.

``old`` and ``new`` will have varying types depending on the type of
callback.

\*\*kwargs
^^^^^^^^

A dictionary containing any constraints and/or additional user specific
keyword arguments supplied to the ``listen_state()`` call.

The kwargs dictionary will also contain a field called ``handle`` that provides the callback with the handle that identifies the ``listen_state()`` entry that resulted in the callback.

Publishing State from an App
----------------------------

Using AppDaemon, it is possible to explicitly publish state from an App.
The published state can contain whatever you want, and is treated
exactly like any other HA state, e.g., to the rest of AppDaemon, and the
dashboard it looks like an entity. This means that you can listen for
state changes in other apps and also publish arbitrary state to the
dashboard via the use of specific entity IDs. To publish state, you will use
``set_app_state()``. State can be retrieved and listened for with the
usual AppDaemon calls.

The Scheduler
-------------

AppDaemon contains a powerful scheduler that is able to run with microsecond
resolution to fire off specific events at set times, or after set
delays, or even relative to sunrise and sunset.

About Schedule Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As with State Change callbacks, Scheduler Callbacks expect to call into
functions with a known and specific signature and a class defined
Scheduler callback function should look like this:

.. code:: python

      def my_callback(self, kwargs):
        <do some useful work here>

You can call the function whatever you like; you will reference it in
the Scheduler call, and you can create as many callback functions as you
need.

The parameters have the following meanings:

self
^^^^

A standard Python object reference

\*\*kwargs
^^^^^^^^^^

A dictionary containing Zero or more keyword arguments to be supplied to
the callback.

Creation of Scheduler Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scheduler callbacks are created through use of a number of convenience
functions which can be used to suit the situation.

Scheduler Randomization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of the scheduler calls above support 2 additional optional
arguments, ``random_start`` and ``random_end``. Using these arguments it
is possible to randomize the firing of callbacks to the degree desired
by setting the appropriate number of seconds with the parameters.

-  ``random_start`` - start of range of the random time
-  ``random_end`` - end of range of the random time

``random_start`` must always be numerically lower than ``random_end``,
they can be negative to denote a random offset before and event, or
positive to denote a random offset after an event. The event would be an
absolute or relative time or sunrise/sunset depending on which
scheduler call you use, and these values affect the base time by the
specified amount. If not specified, they will default to ``0``.

For example:

.. code:: python

    # Run a callback in 2 minutes minus a random number of seconds between 0 and 60, e.g. run between 60 and 120 seconds from now
    self.handle = self.run_in(callback, 120, random_start = -60, **kwargs)
    # Run a callback in 2 minutes plus a random number of seconds between 0 and 60, e.g. run between 120 and 180 seconds from now
    self.handle = self.run_in(callback, 120, random_end = 60, **kwargs)
    # Run a callback in 2 minutes plus or minus a random number of seconds between 0 and 60, e.g. run between 60 and 180 seconds from now
    self.handle = self.run_in(callback, 120, random_start = -60, random_end = 60, **kwargs)

Sunrise and Sunset
------------------

AppDaemon has a number of features to allow easy tracking of sunrise and
sunset as well as a couple of scheduler functions. Note that the
scheduler functions also support the randomization parameters described
above, but they cannot be used in conjunction with the ``offset``
parameter.

Calling Services
----------------

About Home Assistant Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Services within Home Assistant are how changes are made to the system
and its devices. Services can be used to turn lights on and off, set
thermostats and a whole number of other things. Home Assistant supplies
a single interface to all these disparate services that take arbitrary
parameters. AppDaemon provides the ``call_service()`` function to call
into Home Assistant and run a service. In addition, it also provides
convenience functions for some of the more common services making
calling them a little easier.

Other plugins may or may not support the notion of services

Events
------

About Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Events are a fundamental part of how AppDaemon works under the
covers. AD receives important events from all of its plugins and communicates them to apps as required. For instance, the MQTT plugin will generate an event when a message is received; The HASS plugin will generate an event when a service is called, or when it starts or stops.

Events and MQTT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MQTT plugin uses events as its primary (and only interface) to MQTT. The model is fairly simple - every time an MQTT message is received, and event of type ``MQTT_MESSAGE`` is fired. Apps are able to subscribe to this event and process it appropriately.

Events and Home Assistant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have already seen how state changes can be propagated to AppDaemon via the HASS plugin - a state change however is merely an example of an event within Home Assistant. There are several other event types, among them are:

-  ``homeassistant_start``
-  ``homeassistant_stop``
-  ``state_changed``
-  ``service_registered``
-  ``call_service``
-  ``service_executed``
-  ``platform_discovered``
-  ``component_loaded``

Using the HASS plugin, it is possible to subscribe to specific events as well
as fire off events.

AppDaemon Specific Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the HASS and MQTT supplied events, AppDaemon adds 3 more
events. These are internal to AppDaemon and are not visible on the Home
Assistant bus:

-  ``appd_started`` - fired once when AppDaemon is first started and after Apps are initialized. It is fired within the `global` namespace
- ``app_initialized`` - fired when an App is initialized. It is fired within the `admin` namespace
- ``app_terminated`` - fired when an App is terminated. It is fired within the `admin` namespace
-  ``plugin_started`` - fired when a plugin is initialized and properly setup e.g. connection to Home Assistant. It is fired within the plugin's namespace
-  ``plugin_stopped`` - fired when a plugin terminates, or becomes internally unstable like a disconnection from an external system like an MQTT broker. It is fired within the plugin's namespace
-  ``service_registered`` - fired when a service is registered in AD. It is fired within the namespace it was registered
- ``stream_connected`` - fired when a stream client connects like the Admin User Interface. It is fired within the `admin` namespace
- ``stream_disconnected`` - fired when a stream client disconnects like the Admin User Interface. It is fired within the `admin` namespace

About Event Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As with State Change and Scheduler callbacks, Event Callbacks expect to
call into functions with a known and specific signature and a class
defined Scheduler callback function should look like this:

.. code:: python

      def my_callback(self, event_name, data, kwargs):
        <do some useful work here>

You can call the function whatever you like - you will reference it in
the Scheduler call, and you can create as many callback functions as you
need.

The parameters have the following meanings:

self
^^^^

A standard Python object reference.

event\_name
^^^^^^^^^^^

Name of the event that was called, e.g., ``call_service``.

data
^^^^

Any data that the system supplied with the event as a dict.

kwargs
^^^^^^

A dictionary containing Zero or more user keyword arguments to be
supplied to the callback.

listen\_event()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Listen event sets up a callback for a specific event, or any event.

Synopsis
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    handle = listen_event(function, event = None, **kwargs):

Returns
^^^^^^^

A handle that can be used to cancel the callback.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

function
''''''''

The function to be called when the event is fired.

event
'''''

Name of the event to subscribe to. Can be a standard HASS or MQTT plugin
event such as ``service_registered`` or in the case of HASS, an arbitrary custom event such
as ``"MODE_CHANGE"``. If no event is specified, ``listen_event()`` will
subscribe to all events.

\*\*kwargs (optional)
'''''''''''''''''''''

One or more keyword value pairs representing App specific parameters to
supply to the callback. If the keywords match values within the event
data, they will act as filters, meaning that if they don't match the
values, the callback will not fire.

As an example of this, a Minimote controller when activated will
generate an event called ``zwave.scene_activated``, along with 2 pieces
of data that are specific to the event - ``entity_id`` and ``scene``. If
you include keyword values for either of those, the values supplied to
the ``listen_event()`` 1 call must match the values in the event or it
will not fire. If the keywords do not match any of the data in the event,
they are simply ignored.

Filtering will work with any event type, but it will be necessary to
figure out the data associated with the event to understand what values
can be filtered on. This can be achieved by examining Home Assistant's
logfiles when the event fires.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    self.listen_event(self.mode_event, "MODE_CHANGE")
    # Listen for a minimote event activating scene 3:
    self.listen_event(self.generic_event, "zwave.scene_activated", scene_id = 3)
    # Listen for a minimote event activating scene 3 from a specific minimote:
    self.listen_event(self.generic_event, "zwave.scene_activated", entity_id = "minimote_31", scene_id = 3)

Use of Events for Signalling between Home Assistant and AppDaemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Home Assistant allows for the creation of custom events, and existing
components can send and receive them. This provides a useful mechanism
for signaling back and forth between Home Assistant and AppDaemon. For
instance, if you would like to create a UI Element to fire off some code
in Home Assistant, all that is necessary is to create a script to fire a
custom event, then subscribe to that event in AppDaemon. The script
would look something like this:

.. code:: yaml

    alias: Day
    sequence:
    - event: MODE_CHANGE
      event_data:
        mode: Day

The custom event ``MODE_CHANGE`` would be subscribed to with:

.. code:: python

    self.listen_event(self.mode_event, "MODE_CHANGE")

Home Assistant can send these events in a variety of other places -
within automations, and also directly from Alexa intents. Home Assistant
can also listen for custom events with its automation component. This
can be used to signal from AppDaemon code back to home assistant. Here
is a sample automation:

.. code:: yaml

    automation:
      trigger:
        platform: event
        event_type: MODE_CHANGE
        ...
        ...

This can be triggered with a call to AppDaemon's fire\_event() as
follows:

.. code:: python

    self.fire_event("MODE_CHANGE", mode = "Day")

Use of Events for Interacting with HADashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HADashboard listens for certain events. An event type of "hadashboard"
will trigger certain actions such as page navigation. For more
information see the `Dashboard configuration pages <DASHBOARD.html>`__

AppDaemon provides convenience functions to assist with this.

HASS Presence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Presence in Home Assistant is tracked using Device Trackers. The state
of all device trackers can be found using the ``get_state()`` call.
However, AppDaemon provides several convenience functions to make this
easier.

Writing to Logfiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AppDaemon uses 2 separate logs - the general log and the error log. An
App can write to either of these using the supplied
convenience methods ``log()`` and ``error()``, which are provided as
part of parent ``AppDaemon`` class, and the call will automatically
pre-pend the name of the App making the call.

The functions are based on the Python ``logging`` module and are able to pass through parameters for interpolation, and additional parameters such as ``exc_info`` just as with the usual style of invocation. Use of loggers interpolation method over the use of ``format()`` is recommended for performance reasons, as logger will only interpolate of the line is actually written whereas ``format()`` will always do the substitution.

The ``-D`` option of AppDaemon can be used to specify a global logging level, and Apps can individually have their logging level set as required. This can be achieved using the ``set_log_level()`` API call, or by using the special ``debug`` argument to the apps settings in ``apps.yaml``:

.. code:: yaml

    log_level: DEBUG

In addition, apps can select a default log for the `log()` call using the `log` directive in apps.yaml, referencing the section name in appdaemon.yaml. This can be one of the 4 builtin logs, ``main_log``, ``error_log``, ``diag_log`` and ``access_log``, or a user-defined log, e.g.:

.. code:: yaml

    log: test_log

If an App has set a default log other than one of the 4 built in logs, these logs can still be accessed specifically using either the `log=` parameter of the `log()` call, or by getting the appropriate logger object using the `get_user_log()` call, which also works for default logs.

AppDaemon's logging mechanism also allows you to use placeholders for the module,
function, and line number. If you include the following in the test of
your message:

::

    __function__
    __module__
    __line__

They will automatically be expanded to the appropriate values in the log
message.

Getting Information in Apps and Sharing information between Apps
----------------------------------------------------------------

Sharing information between different Apps is very simple if required.
Each App gets access to a global dictionary stored in a class attribute
called ``self.global_vars``. Any App can add or read any key as
required. This operation is not, however, threadsafe so some care is
needed - see the section on threading for more details.

In addition, Apps have access to the entire configuration if required,
meaning they can access AppDaemon configuration items as well as
parameters from other Apps. To use this, there is a class attribute
called ``self.config``. It contains a standard Python nested ``Dictionary``.

To get AppDaemon's config parameters for example:

.. code:: python

    app_timezone = self.config["time_zone"]


To access any apps parameters, use the class attribute called ``app_config``. This is
a Python Dictionary with an entry for each App, keyed on the App's name.

.. code:: python

    other_apps_arg = self.app_config["some_app"]["some_parameter"].


AppDaemon also exposes the configurations from configured plugins. For example, that of the HA plugin
allows accessing configurations from Home Assistant such as the
Latitude and Longitude configured in HA. All of the information
available from the Home Assistant ``/api/config`` endpoint is available
using the ``get_config()`` call. E.g.:

.. code:: python

    config = self.get_config()
    self.log("My current position is {}(Lat), {}(Long)".format(config["latitude"], config["longitude"]))

Using this method, it is also possible to use this function to access configurations of other plugins,
from within apps in a different namespace. This is done by simply passing in the ``namespace`` parameter. E.g.:

.. code:: python
    ## from within a HASS App, and wanting to access the client Id of the MQTT Plugin

    config = self.get_config(namespace = 'mqtt')
    self.log("The Mqtt Client ID is ".format(config["client_id"]))

And finally, it is also possible to use ``config`` as a global area
for sharing parameters across Apps. Simply add the required parameters
inside the appdaemon section in the appdaemon.yaml file:

.. code:: yaml

    logs:
    ...
    appdaemon:
      global_var: hello world

Then access it as follows:

.. code:: python

    my_global_var = self.config["global_var"]

Development Workflow
--------------------

Developing Apps is intended to be fairly simple but is an exercise in
programming like any other kind of Python program. As such, it is
expected that apps will contain syntax errors and will generate
exceptions during the development process. AppDaemon makes it very easy
to iterate through the development process as it will automatically
reload code that has changed and also will reload code if any of the
parameters in the configuration file change as well.

The recommended workflow for development is as follows:

-  Open a window and tail the ``appdaemon.log`` file
-  Open a second window and tail the ``error.log`` file
-  Open a third window or the editor of your choice for editing the App

With this setup, you will see that every time you write the file,
AppDaemon will log the fact and let you know it has reloaded the App in
the ``appdaemon.log`` file.

If there is an error in the compilation or a runtime error, this will be
directed to the ``error.log`` file to enable you to see the error and
correct it. When an error occurs, there will also be a warning message
in ``appdaemon.log`` to tell you to check the error log.

Scheduler Speed
---------------

The scheduler has been redesigned in 4.0 with a new tickles algorithm that allows you to specify timed events to the limit of the host system's accuracy (this is usually down to the microsecond level).

Time Travel
-----------

OK, time travel sadly isn't really possible but it can be very useful
when testing Apps. For instance, imagine you have an App that turns a
light on every day at sunset. It might be nice to test it without
waiting for Sunset - and with AppDaemon's "Time Travel" features you
can.

Choosing a Start Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Internally, AppDaemon keeps track of its own time relative to when it
was started. This make it possible to start AppDaemon with a different
start time and date to the current time. For instance, to test that
sunset App, start AppDaemon at a time just before sunset and see if it
works as expected. To do this, simply use the "-s" argument on
AppDaemon's command line. e.g.:

.. code:: bash

    $ apprun -s "2018-23-27 16:30:00"
    ...
    2018-12-27 09:31:20.794106 INFO     AppDaemon  App initialization complete
    2018-23-27 16:30:00.000000 INFO     AppDaemon  Starting time travel ...
    2018-23-27 16:30:00:50.000000 INFO     AppDaemon  Setting clocks to 2018-23-27 16:30:00
    2018-23-27 16:30:00.000000 INFO     AppDaemon  Time displacement factor 1.0
    ...

Note the timestamps in the log - AppDaemon believes it is now just
before sunset and will process any callbacks appropriately.

Speeding things up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some Apps need to run for periods of a day or two for you to test all aspects. This can be time-consuming, but Time Travel can also help here by speeding uptime. To do this, simply use the ``-t`` (timewarp) option on the command line. This option is a simple multiplier for the speed that time will run. If set to 10, time as far as AppDaemon is concerned will run 10 times faster than usual. Set it to 0,1, and time will run 10 times slower. A few examples:

Set appdaemon to run 10x faster than normal:

.. code:: bash

    $ appdaemon -t 10

Set appdaemon to run as fast as possible:

.. code:: bash

    $ appdaemon -t 0


The ``timewarp`` flag in ``appdaemon.yaml`` is an alternative way of changing the speed, and will override the ``-t`` command line setting.

Automatically stopping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AppDaemon can be set to terminate automatically at a specific time. This
can be useful if you want to repeatedly rerun a test, for example, to
test that random values are behaving as expected. Simply specify the end
time with the ``-e`` flag as follows:

.. code:: bash

    $ appdaemon -e "2016-06-06 10:10:00"
    2016-09-06 17:16:00 INFO AppDaemon Version 1.3.2 starting
    2016-09-06 17:16:00 INFO Got initial state
    2016-09-06 17:16:00 INFO Loading Module: /export/hass/appdaemon_test/conf/test_apps/sunset.py
    ..,

The ``-e`` flag is most useful when used in conjunction with the ``-s``
flag and optionally the ``-t`` flag. For example, to run from just
before sunset, for an hour, as fast as possible:

.. code:: bash

    $ appdaemon -s "2016-06-06 19:16:00" -e "2016-06-06 20:16:00" -t 10

A Note On Times
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some Apps you write may depend on checking times of events relative to
the current time. If you are time travelling this will not work if you
use standard python library calls to get the current time and date etc.
For this reason, always use the AppDamon supplied ``time()``, ``date()``
and ``datetime()`` calls, documented earlier. These calls will consult
with AppDaemon's internal time rather than the actual time and give you
the correct values.

Other Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AppDaemon allows some introspection on its stored schedule and callbacks
which may be useful for some applications. The functions:

-  get\_scheduler\_entries()
-  get\_callback\_entries()

Return the internal data structures, but do not allow them to be
modified directly. Their format may change.

About Plugin Disconnections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a plugin is unable to connect initially with the underlying system, e.g., Home Assistant, it
will hold all Apps in stasis until it initially connects, nothing else
will happen, and no initialization routines will be called. If AppDaemon
has been running connected to Home Assistant for a while and the
connection is unexpectedly lost, the following will occur:

-  When the plugin first goes down or becomes disconnected, an event called
   ``plugin_disconnected`` will fire
-  While disconnected from the plugin, Apps will continue to run
-  Schedules will continue to be honored
-  Any operation reading locally cached state will succeed
-  Any operation requiring a call to the plugin will log a warning and return
   without attempting to contact hass

When a connection to the plugin is reestablished, all Apps will be restarted
and their ``initialize()`` routines will be called.

RESTFul API Support
-------------------

AppDaemon supports a simple RESTFul API to enable arbitrary HTTP
connections to pass data to Apps and trigger actions. API Calls must use
a content type of ``application/json``, and the response will be JSON
encoded. The RESTFul API is disabled by default, but is enabled by
adding an ``api_port`` directive to the AppDaemon section of the
configuration file. The API can run http or https if desired, separately
from the dashboard.

To call into a specific App, construct a URL, use the regular
HADashboard URL, and append ``/api/appdaemon``, then add the name of the
endpoint as registered by the App on the end, for example:

::

    http://192.168.1.20:5050/api/appdaemon/hello_endpoint

This URL will call into an App that registered an endpoint named ``hello_endpoint``.

Within the App, a call must be made to ``register_endpoint()`` to tell AppDaemon that
the App is expecting calls on that endpoint. When registering an endpoint, the App
supplies a function to be called when a request comes into that endpoint and an optional
name for the endpoint. If not specified, the name will default to the name of the App
as specified in the configuration file.

Apps can have as many endpoints as required, however, the names must be unique across
all of the Apps in an AppDaemon instance.

It is also possible to remove endpoints with the ``unregister_endpoint()`` call, making the
endpoints truly dynamic and under the control of the App.

Here is an example of an App using the API:

.. code:: python

    import hassapi as hass

    class API(hass.Hass):

        def initialize(self):
            self.register_endpoint(my_callback, "test_endpoint")

        def my_callback(self, data):

            self.log(data)

            response = {"message": "Hello World"}

            return response, 200

The response must be a python structure that can be mapped to JSON, or
can be blank, in which case specify ``""`` for the response. You should
also return an HTML status code, that will be reported back to the
caller, ``200`` should be used for an OK response.

As well as any user specified code, the API can return the following
codes:

-  400 - JSON Decode Error
-  401 - Unauthorized
-  404 - App not found

Below is an example of using curl to call into the App shown above:

.. code:: bash

    $ curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://192.168.1.20:5050/api/appdaemon/test_endpoint -d '{"type": "Hello World Test"}'
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 26
    Date: Sun, 06 Aug 2017 16:38:14 GMT
    Server: Python/3.5 aiohttp/2.2.3

    {"message": "Hello World"}hass@Pegasus:~$

API Security
------------

If you have added a key to the AppDaemon config, AppDaemon will expect
to find a header called "*x-ad-access*" in the request with a value equal
to the configured key. A security key is added for the API with the
``api_key`` directive described in the `Installation
Documentation <INSTALL.html>`__

If these conditions are not met, the call will fail with a return code
of ``401 Not Authorized``. Here is a successful curl example:

.. code:: bash

    $ curl -i -X POST -H "x-ad-access: fred" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://192.168.1.20:5050/api/appdaemon/api -d '{"type": "Hello World Test"}'
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 26
    Date: Sun, 06 Aug 2017 17:30:50 GMT
    Server: Python/3.5 aiohttp/2.2.3

    {"message": "Hello World"}hass@Pegasus:~$

And an example of a missing key:

.. code:: bash

    $ curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://192.168.1.20:5050/api/appdaemon/api -d '{"type": "Hello World Test"}'
    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    Content-Length: 112
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    Date: Sun, 06 Aug 2017 17:30:43 GMT
    Server: Python/3.5 aiohttp/2.2.3

    <html><head><title>401 Unauthorized</title></head><body><h1>401 Unauthorized</h1>Error in API Call</body></html>hass@Pegasus:~$

Alexa Support
-------------

AppDaemon is able to use the API support to accept calls from Alexa.
Amazon Alexa calls can be directed to AppDaemon and arrive as JSON
encoded requests. AppDaemon provides several helper functions to assist
in understanding the request and responding appropriately. Since Alexa
only allows one URL per skill, the mapping will be 1:1 between skills
and Apps. When constructing the URL in the Alexa Intent, make sure it
points to the correct endpoint for the App you are using for Alexa.

In addition, if you are using API security keys (recommended) you will
need to append it to the end of the URL as follows:

::

    http://<some.host.com>/api/appdaemon/alexa?api_password=<password>

For more information about configuring Alexa Intents, see the `Home
Assistant Alexa
Documentation <https://home-assistant.io/components/alexa/>`__

When configuring Alexa support for AppDaemon some care is needed. If you are as
most people, you are using SSL to access Home Assistant, there is
contention for the use of the SSL port (443) since Alexa does not allow you
to change this. This means that if you want to use AppDaemon with SSL,
you will not be able to use Home Assistant remotely over SSL. The way
around this is to use NGINX to remap the specific AppDamon API URL to a
different port, by adding something like this to the config:

::

            location /api/appdaemon/ {
            allow all;
            proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_redirect http:// http://;
          }

Here we see the default port being remapped to port 5000 which is where
AppDamon is listening in my setup.

Since each individual Skill has its own URL it is possible to have
different skills for Home Assistant and AppDaemon.

Putting it together in an App
-----------------------------

The Alexa App is basically just a standard API App that uses Alexa
helper functions to understand the incoming request and format a
response to be sent back to Amazon, to describe the spoken response and
card for Alexa.

Here is a sample of an Alexa App that can be extended for whatever intents you
want to configure.

.. code:: python

    import hassapi as hass
    import random
    import globals

    class Alexa(hass.Hass):

        def initialize(self):
            pass

        def api_call(self, data):
            intent = self.get_alexa_intent(data)

            if intent is None:

Dialogflow API
-------------

Similarly, Dialogflow API for Google home is supported - here is the Google version of the same App. To set up Dialogflow with your google home refer to the `apiai` component in home-assistant. Once it is setup you can use the AppDaemon API as the webhook.

.. code:: python

    import hassapi as hass
    import random
    import globals

    class Apiai(hass.Hass):

        def initialize(self):
            pass

        def api_call(self, data):
            intent = self.get_dialogflow_intent(data)

            if intent is None:
                self.log("Dialogflow error encountered: Result is empty")
                return "", 201

            intents = {
                "StatusIntent": self.StatusIntent,
                "LocateIntent": self.LocateIntent,
            }

            if intent in intents:
                speech = intents[intent](data)
                response = self.format_dialogflow_response(speech)
                self.log("Received Dialogflow request: {}, answering: {}".format(intent, speech))
            else:
                response = self.format_dialogflow_response(speech = "I'm sorry, the {} does not exist within AppDaemon".format(intent))

            return response, 200

        def StatusIntent(self, data):
            response = self.HouseStatus()
            return response

        def LocateIntent(self, data):
            user = self.get_dialogflow_slot_value(data, "User")

            if user is not None:
                if user.lower() == "jack":
                    response = self.Jack()
                elif user.lower() == "andrew":
                    response = self.Andrew()
                elif user.lower() == "wendy":
                    response = self.Wendy()
                elif user.lower() == "brett":
                    response = "I have no idea where Brett is, he never tells me anything"
                else:
                    response = "I'm sorry, I don't know who {} is".format(user)
            else:
                response = "I'm sorry, I don't know who that is"

            return response

        def HouseStatus(self):

            status = "The downstairs temperature is {} degrees fahrenheit,".format(self.entities.sensor.downstairs_thermostat_temperature.state)
            status += "The upstairs temperature is {} degrees fahrenheit,".format(self.entities.sensor.upstairs_thermostat_temperature.state)

            status += self.Wendy()

            status += self.Jack()

            return status

        def Wendy(self):
            location = self.get_state(globals.wendy_tracker)
            if location == "home":
                status = "Wendy is home,"
            else:
                status = "Wendy is away,"

            return status

        def Andrew(self):
            location = self.get_state(globals.andrew_tracker)
            if location == "home":
                status = "Andrew is home,"
            else:
                status = "Andrew is away,"

            return status

        def Jack(self):

                "Jack is by his bowl waiting for treats"
            ]

            return random.choice(responses)

Plugins
-------

As of version 3.0, AppDaemon has been rewritten to use a pluggable architecture for connection to the systems it monitors.

It is possible to create plugins that interface with other systems, for instance, MQTT support was recently added and it would also be possible to connect to other home automation systems, or anything else for that matter, and expose their operation to AppDaemon and write Apps to monitor and control them.

An interesting caveat of this is that the architecture has been designed so that multiple instances of each plugin can be configured, meaning for instance that it is possible to connect AppDaemon to 2 or more instances of Home Assistant.

To configure additional plugins of any sort, simply add a new section in the list of plugins in the AppDaemon section.

Here is an example of a plugin section with 2 hass instances and 2 dummy instances:

.. code:: yaml

  plugins:
    HASS1:
      type: hass
      ha_key: !secret home_assistant1_key
      ha_url: http://192.168.1.20:8123
    HASS2:
      namespace: hass2
      type: hass
      ha_key: !secret home_assistant2_key
      ha_url: http://192.168.1.21:8123
    MQTT:
      type: mqtt
      namespace: mqtt
      client_host: 192.168.1.20
      client_port: 1883
      client_id: Fred
      client_user: homeassistant
      client_password: my_password

The ``type`` parameter defines which of the plugins are used, and the parameters for each plugin type will be different.
As you can see, the parameters for both hass instances are similar, and it supports all the parameters described in the
installation section of the docs - here I am just using a subset.

Namespaces
----------

A critical piece of this is the concept of ``namespaces``. Each plugin has an optional ``namespace`` directive. If you have more than 1 plugin of any type, their state is separated into namespaces, and you need to name those namespaces using the ``namespace`` parameter. If you don't supply a namespace, the namespace defaults to ``default`` and this is the default for all areas of AppDaemon meaning that if you only have one plugin you don't need to worry about namespace at all.

In the case above, the first instance had no namespace so its namespace will be called ``default``. The second hass namespace will be ``hass2`` and so on.

These namespaces can be accessed separately by the various API calls to keep things separate, but individual Apps can switch between namespaces at will as well as monitor all namespaces in certain calls like ``listen_state()`` or ``listen_event()`` by setting the namespace to ``global``.

Use of Namespaces in Apps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each App maintains a current namespace at all times. At initialization, this is set to ``default``. This means that if you only have a single plugin, you don't need to worry about namespaces at all as everything will just work.

There are 2 ways to work with namespaces in apps. The first is to make a call to ``set_namespace()`` whenever you want to change namespaces. For instance, if in the configuration above, you wanted a particular App to work entirely with the ``HASS2`` plugin instance, all you would need to do is put the following code at the top of your ``initialize()`` function:

.. code:: python

    self.set_namespace("hass2")

Note that you should use the value of the namespace parameter, not the name of the plugin section. From that point on, all state changes, events, service calls, etc. will apply to the ``HASS2`` instance and the ``HASS1`` and ``DUMMY`` instances will be ignored. This is convenient for the case in which you don't need to switch between namespaces.

In addition, most of the API calls allow you to optionally supply a namespace for them to operate under. This will override the namespace set by ``set_namespace()`` for that call only.

For example:

.. code:: python

    self.set_namespace("hass2")
    # Get the entity value from the HASS2 plugin
    # Since the HASS2 plugin is configured with a namespace of "hass2"
    state = self.get_state("light.light1")

    # Get the entity value from the HASS1 plugin
    # Since the HASS1 plugin is configured with a namespace of "default"
    state = self.get_state("light.light1", namespace="default")

In this way it is possible to use a single App to work with multiple namespaces easily and quickly.

A Note on Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One important thing to note, when working with namespaces is that callbacks will honor the namespace they were created with. So if for instance, you create a ``listen_state()`` callback with a namespace of ``default`` then later change the namespace to ``hass1``, that callback will continue to listen to the ``default`` namespace.

For instance:

.. code:: python

    self.set_namespace("default")
    self.listen_state(callback)
    self.set_namespace("hass2")
    self.listen_state(callback)
    self.set_namespace("dummy1")

This will leave us with 2 callbacks, one listening for state changes in ``default`` and one for state changes in ``hass2``, regardless of the final value of the namespace.

Similarly:

.. code:: python

    self.set_namespace("dummy2")
    self.listen_state(callback, namespace="default")
    self.listen_state(callback, namespace="hass2")
    self.set_namespace("dummy1")

This code fragment will achieve the same result as above since the namespace is being overridden, and will
keep the same value for that callback regardless of what the namespace is set to.

User Defined Namespaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each plugin has it's own unique namespace as described above, and they are pretty much in control of those
namespaces. It is possible to set a state in a plugin managed namespace which can be used as a temporary
variable or even as a way of signalling other apps using ``listen_state()`` however this is not recommended:

- Plugin managed namespaces may be overwritten at any time by the plugin
- They will likely be overwritten when the plugin restarts even if AppDaemon does not
- They will not survive a restart of AppDaemon because it is regarded as the job of the plugin to reconstruct it's state and it knows nothing about any additional variables you have added. Although this technique can still be useful, for example, to add sensors to Home Assistant, a better alternative for Apps to use are User Defined Namespaces.


A User Defined Namespace is a new area of storage for entities that is not managed by a plugin. UDMs are guaranteed
not to be changed by any plugin and are available to all apps just the same as a plugin-based namespace. UDMs also
survive AppDaemon restarts and crashes, creating durable storage for saving the information and communicating with
other apps via ``listen_state()`` and ``set_state()``.

They are configured in the ``appdaemon.yaml`` file as follows:

.. code:: yaml

    namespaces:
        my_namespace:
          # writeback is safe, performance or hybrid
          writeback: safe
        my_namespace2:
          writeback: performance
        my_namespace3:
          writeback: hybrid

Here we are defining 3 new namespaces - you can have as many as you want. Their names are ``my_namespace1``, ``my_namespace2`` and ``my_namespace3``. UDMs are written to disk so that they survive restarts, and this can be done in 3 different ways, set by the writeback parameter for each UDM. They are:

- ``safe`` - the namespace is written to disk every time a change is made so will be up to date even if a crash happens. The downside is that there is a possible performance impact for systems with slower disks, or that set state on many UDMs at a time.
- ``performance`` - the namespace is written when AD exits, meaning that all processing is in memory for the best performance. Although this style of UDM will survive a restart, data may be lost if AppDaemon or the host crashes.
- ``hybrid`` - a compromise setting in which the namespaces are saved periodically (once each time around the utility loop, usually once every second- with this setting a maximum of 1 second of data will be lost if AppDaemon crashes.

Using Multiple APIs From One App
--------------------------------

The way apps are constructed, they inherit from a superclass that contains all the methods needed to access a particular plugin. This is convenient as it hides a lot of the complexity by automatically selecting the right configuration information based on namespaces. One drawback of this approach is that an App cannot inherently speak to multiple plugin types as the API required is different, and the App can only choose one API to inherit from.

To get around this, a function called ``get_plugin_api()`` is provided to instantiate API objects to handle multiple plugins, as a distinct objects, not part of the APPs inheritance. Once the new API object is obtained, you can make plugin-specific API calls on it directly, as well as call ``listen_state()`` on it to listen for state changes specific to that plugin.

In this case, it is cleaner not to have the App inherit from one or the other specific APIs, and for this reason, the ADBase class is provided to create an App without any specific plugin API. The App will also use ``get_ad_api()`` to get access to the AppDaemon API for the various scheduler calls.

As an example, this App is built using ADBase, and uses ``get_plugin_api()`` to access both HASS and MQTT, as well as ``get_ad_api()`` to access the AppDaemon base functions.

.. code:: python

    import adbase as ad

    class GetAPI(ad.ADBase):

      def initialize(self):

        # Grab an object for the HASS API
        hass = self.get_plugin_api("HASS")
        # Hass API Call
        hass.turn_on("light.office")
        # Listen for state changes for this plugin only
        hass.listen_state(my_callback, "light.kitchen")

        # Grab an object for the MQTT API
        mqtt = self.get_plugin_api("MQTT")
        # Make MQTT API Call
        mqtt.mqtt_publish("topic", "Payload"):

        # Make a scheduler call using the ADBase class
        adbase = self.get_ad_api()
        handle = adbase.run_in(callback, 20)

By default, each plugin API object has it's namespace correctly set for that plugin, which makes it much more convenient to handle calls and callbacks form that plugin. This way of working can often be more convenient and clearer than changing namespaces within apps or on the individual calls, so is the recommended way to handle multiple plugins of the same or even different types. The AD base API's namespace defaults to "default":

.. code:: python

    # Listen for state changes specific to the "HASS" plugin
    hass.listen_state(hass_callback, "light.office")
    # Listen for state changes specific to the "MQTT" plugin
    mqtt.listen_state(mqtt_callback, "light.office")
    # Listen for global state changes
    adbase.listen_state(global_callback, namespace="global")

API objects are fairly lightweight and can be created and discarded at will. There may be a slight performance increase by creating an object for each API in the initialize function and using it throughout the App, but this is likely to be minimal.

Custom Constraints
------------------

An App can also register its own custom constraints which can then be used in exactly the same way as
App level or callback level constraints. A custom constraint is simply a Python function that returns ``True`` or ``False`` when presented with the constraint argument. If it returns ``True``, the constraint is regarded as satisfied, and the callback will be made (subject to any other constraints also evaluating to ``True``. Likewise, a False return means that the callback won't fire. Custom constraints are a handy way to control multiple callbacks that have some complex logic and enable you to avoid duplicating code in all callbacks.

To use a custom constraint, it is first necessary to register the function to be used to evaluate it using the ``register_constraint()`` API call. Constraints can also be unregistered using the ``deregister_constraint()`` call, and the ``list_constraints()`` call will return a list of currently registered constraints.

Here is an example of how this all fits together.

We start off with a python function that accepts a value to be evaluated like this:

.. code:: python

    def is_daylight(self, value):
        if self.sun_up():
            return True
        else:
            return False

To use this in a callback level constraint simply use:

.. code:: python

        self.register_constraint("is_daylight")
        handle = self.run_every(self.callback, time, 1, is_daylight=1)

Now ``callback()`` will only fire if the sun is up.

Using the value parameter you can parameterize the constraint for more complex behavior and use in different situations for different callbacks. For instance:

.. code:: python

    def sun(self, value):
        if value == "up":
            if self.sun_up():
            return True
        elif value == "down":
            if self.sun_down():
            return True
        return False


You can use this with 2 separate constraints like so:

.. code:: python

        self.register_constraint("sun")
        handle = self.run_every(self.up_callback, time, 1, sun="up")
        handle = self.run_every(self.down_callback, time, 1, sun="down")

Sequences
---------

AppDaemon supports `sequences` as a simple way of re-using predefined steps of commands. The initial usecase for sequences
is to allow users to create scenes within AppDaemon, however they are useful for many other things. Sequences
are fairly simple and allow the user to define 2 types of activity:

- A call_service command with arbitrary parameters
- A configurable delay between steps.

In the case of a scene, of course you would not want to use the delay, and would just list all the devices to be switched
on or off, however, if you wanted a light to come on for 30 seconds, you could use a script to turn the light on,
wait 30 seconds and then turn it off. Unlike in synchronous apps, delays are fine in scripts as they will
not hold the apps_thread up.

There are 2 types of sequence - predefined sequences and inline sequences.

Defining a Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A predefined sequence is created by adding a ``sequence`` section to your apps.yaml file. If you have apps.yaml split into
multiple files, you can have sequences defined in each one if desired. For clarity, it is strongly recommended that
sequences are created in their own standalone yaml files, ideally in a separate directory from the app argument files.

An example of a simple sequence entry to create a couple of scenes might be:

.. code:: yaml

    sequence:
      office_on:
        name: Office On
        steps:
        - homeassistant/turn_on:
            entity_id: light.office_1
            brightness: 254
        - homeassistant/turn_on:
            entity_id: light.office_2
            brightness: 254
      office_off:
        name: Office Off
        steps:
        - homeassistant/turn_off:
            entity_id: light.office_1
        - homeassistant/turn_off:
            entity_id: light.office_2


The names of the sequences defined above are ``sequence.office_on`` and ``sequence.office_off``. The ``name`` entry is optional and is used to provide
a friendly name for HADashboard. The ``steps`` entry is simply a list of steps to be taken. They will be processed in
the order defined, however without any delays the steps will be processed practically instantaneously.

A sequence to turn a light on then off after a delay might look like this:

.. code:: yaml

    sequence:
      outside_motion_light:
        name: Outside Motion
        steps:
        - homeassistant/turn_on:
            entity_id: light.outside
            brightness: 254
        - sleep: 30
        - homeassistant/turn_off:
            entity_id: light.outside

If you prefer, you can use YAML's inline capabilities for a more compact representation that looks better for longer sequences:

.. code:: yaml

    sequence:
      outside_motion_light:
        name: Outside Motion
        steps:
        - homeassistant/turn_on: {"entity_id": "light.outside", "brightness": 254}
        - sleep: 30
        - homeassistant/turn_off: {"entity_id": "light.outside"}

Sequences can be created that will loop forever by adding the value ``loop: True`` to the sequence:

.. code:: yaml

    sequence:
      outside_motion_light:
        name: Outside Motion
        loop; True
        steps:
        - homeassistant/turn_on: {"entity_id": "light.outside", "brightness": 254}
        - sleep: 30
        - homeassistant/turn_off: {"entity_id": "light.outside"}

This sequence once started will loop until either the sequence is canceled, the app is restarted or terminated, or AppDaemon is shutdown.

By default, a sequence will run on entities in the current namespace, however , the namespace can be specified on a per call
basis if required.

.. code:: yaml

    sequence:
      office_on:
        name: Office On
        steps:
        - homeassistant/turn_on:
            entity_id: light.office_1
            brightness: 254
            namespace: "hass1"
        - homeassistant/turn_on:
            entity_id: light.office_2
            brightness: 254
            namespace: "hass2"

Just like app parameters and code, sequences will be reloaded after any change has been made allowing scenes to be
developed and modified without restarting AppDaemon.

Sequence Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to a straightforward service name plus data, sequences can take a few additional commands:

- sleep - pause execution of the sequence for a number of seconds. e.g. `sleep: 30` will pause the sequence for 30 seconds
- sequence - run a sub sequence. This must be a predefined sequence, and cannot be an inline sequence. Provide the entity
name of the sub-sequence to be run, e.g. `sequence: sequcene.my_sub_sequence`. Sub sequences can be nested arbitrarily
to any desired level.

Running a Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have the sequence defined, you can run it in one of 2 ways:

- using the ``self.run_sequence()`` api call
- Using a sequence widget in HADashboard

A call to run the above sequence would look like this:

.. code:: python

    handle = self.run_sequence("sequence.outside_motion_light")

The handle value can be used to terminate a running sequence by supplying it to the ``cancel_sequence()`` call.

When an app is terminated or reloaded, all running sequences that it started are immediately terminated. There is no way
to terminate a sequence started using HADashboard.

Inline Sequences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sequences can be run without the need to predefine them by specifying the steps to the ``run_sequence()`` command like so:

.. code:: python

     handle = self.run_sequence([
            {'light/turn_on': {'entity_id': 'light.office_1', 'brightness': '5', 'color_name': 'white', 'namespace': 'default'}},
            {'sleep': 1},
            {'light/turn_off': {'entity_id': 'light.office_1'}},
            ])
