Configuration
-------------

When you have appdaemon installed by either method you are ready to
start working on the appdaemon.yaml file. For docker users, you will
already have a skeleton to work with. For pip users, you need to create
a configuration directory somewhere (e.g. ``/home/homeassistant/conf``)
and create a file in there called ``appdaemon.yaml``.

Initial Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your initial ``appdaemon.yaml`` file should look something like this if you are using the HASS plugin:

.. code:: yaml

     appdaemon:
       threads: 10
       plugins:
         HASS:
           type: hass
           ha_url: <some_url>
           token: <some_long_lived_access_token>

The top level consists of a number of sections:

log
~~~

The ``log:`` section is optional but if included, must have at least one directive in it. The directives are as follows:

-  ``logfile`` (optional) is the path to where you want ``AppDaemon`` to
   keep its main log. When run from the command line this is not used
   -log messages come out on the terminal. When running as a daemon this
   is where the log information will go. In the example above I created
   a directory specifically for AppDaemon to run from, although there is
   no reason you can't keep it in the ``appdaemon`` directory of the
   cloned repository. If ``logfile = STDOUT``, output will be sent to
   stdout instead of stderr when running in the foreground, if not
   specified, output will be sent to STDOUT.
-  ``errorfile`` (optional) is the name of the logfile for errors - this
   will usually be errors during compilation and execution of the apps.
   If ``errorfile = STDERR`` errors will be sent to stderr instead of a
   file, if not specified, output will be sent to STDERR.
-  ``diagfile`` (optional) is the name of the log files for diagnostic information. This will contain information form the ``log_thread_actions`` parameter, as well as information dumped from AppDaemon's internal state when the AppDaemon process is sent a ``SIGUSR1`` signal.
-  ``log_size`` (optional) is the maximum size a logfile will get to
   before it is rotated if not specified, this will default to 1000000
   bytes.
-  ``log_generations`` (optional) is the number of rotated logfiles that
   will be retained before they are overwritten if not specified, this
   will default to 3 files.

appdaemon
~~~~~~~~~

The ``appdaemon:`` section has a number of directives:

-  ``threads`` (required) - the number of dedicated worker threads to create for
   running the apps. Note, this will bear no resembelance to the number
   of apps you have, the threads are re-used and only active for as long
   as required to run a particular callback or initialization, leave
   this set to 10 unless you experience thread starvation
-  ``filters`` (optional) - see below
-  ``plugins`` (required) - see below
-  ``latitude`` (optional) - latitude for AppDaemon to use. If not
   specified, AppDaemon will query the latitude from Home Assistant
-  ``longitude`` (optional) - longitude for AppDaemon to use. If not
   specified, AppDaemon will query the longitude from Home Assistant
-  ``elevation`` (optional) - elevation for AppDaemon to use. If not
   specified, AppDaemon will query the elevation from Home Assistant
-  ``time_zone`` (optional) - timezone for AppDaemon to use. If not
   specified, AppDaemon will query the timezone from Home Assistant
-  ``api_key`` (optional) - adds the requirement for AppDaemon API calls
   to provide a key in the header of a request
-  ``api_ssl_certificate`` (optional) - certificate to use when running
   the API over SSL
-  ``api_ssl_key`` (optional) - key to use when running the API over SSL
-  ``exclude_dirs`` (optional) - a list of subdirectories to ignore under the apps directory when looking for apps
- ``missing_app_warnings`` (optional) - by default, AppDaemon will log a warning if it finds a python file that has no associated configuration in an apps.yaml file. If this parameter is set to ``1`` the warning will be suppressed. This allows non-appdaemon python files to be distributed along with apps.
- ``invalid_yaml_warnings`` (optional) - by default, AppDaemon will log a warning if it finds an apps.yaml file that doesn't include "class" and "module" for an app. If this parameter is set to ``1`` the warning will be suppressed. This is intended to ease the distribution of additional yaml files along with apps.
- ``production_mode`` (optional) - If set to true, AppDaemon will only check for changes in Apps and apps.yaml files when AppDaemon is restarted, as opposed to every second. This can save some processing power on busy systems. Defaults to ``False``
- ``log_thread_actions`` (optional) - if set to 1, AppDaemon will log all callbacks on entry and exit for the scheduler, events and state changes - this can be useful for troubleshooting thread starvation issues
When using the ``exclude_dirs`` directive you should supply a list of directory names that should be ignored, e.g.

.. code:: yaml

    exclude_dirs:
        - dir1
        - dir2
        - dir3

AppDaemon will search for matching directory names at any level of the folder hierarchy under appdir and will exclude that directory and any beneath it. It is not possible to match multiple level directory names e.g. ``somedir/dir1``. In that case the match should be on ``dir1``, with the caveat that if you have dir1 anywhere else in the hierarchy it will also be excluded.

secrets
~~~~~~~

AppDaemon supports the use of secrets in the configuration file, to allow separate storage of sensitive information such as passwords. For this to work, AppDaemon expects to find a file called ``secrets.yaml`` in the configuration directory, or a named file introduced by the top level ``secrets:`` section. The file should be a simple list of all the secrets. The secrets can be referred to using a !secret value in the configuration file.

The ``secret:`` section is optional. If it doesn't exist, AppDaemon looks for a file called ``secrets.yaml`` in the config directory.

An example ``secrets.yaml`` might look like this:

.. code:: yaml

    token: ABCDEFG
    appdaemon_key: password456

The secrets can then be referred to as follows:

.. code:: yaml

    appdaemon:
      api_key: !secret appdaemon_key
      threads: '10'
      plugins:
        HASS:
          type: hass
          token: !secret token
          ha_url: http://192.168.1.20:8123

Filters
~~~~~~~

The use of filters allows you to run an arbitary command against a file with a specific extension to generate a new .py file. The usecases for this are varied, but this can be used to run a preprocessor on an app, or perhaps some kind of global substitute or any of a number of other commands. AppDaemon, when made aware of the filter via configuration, will look for files in the appdir with the specified extension, and run the specified command on them writing the output to a new file with the specified extension. The output extension would usually be a .py file which would then be picked up by normal app processing, meaning that if you edit the original input file, the result will be a new .py file that is part of an app which will then be restarted.

In addition, it is possible to chain multiple filters, as the filter list is processed in order - just ensure you end with a .py file.

A simple filter would look like this:

    .. code:: yaml

        filters:
          - command_line: /bin/cat $1 > $2
            input_ext: cat
            output_ext: py

This would result in AppDaemon looking for any files with the extension ``.cat`` and running the ``/bin/cat`` command and creating a file with an extension of ``.py``. In the ``command_line``, ``$1`` and ``$2`` are replaced by the correctly named input and output files. In this example the output is just a copy of the input but this technique could be used with commands such as sed and awk, or even m4 for more complex manipulations.

A chained set of filters might look like this:

    .. code:: yaml

        filters:
          - command_line: /bin/cat $1 > $2
            input_ext: mat
            output_ext: cat
          - command_line: /bin/cat $1 > $2
            input_ext: cat
            output_ext: py

These will run in order resulting in edits to a ``.mat`` file running through the 2 filters and resulting in a new .py file which will run as the app in the usual way.

Finally, it is possible to have multiple unconnected fiters like so:

    .. code:: yaml

        filters:
          - command_line: /bin/cat $1 > $2
            input_ext: mat
            output_ext: .py
          - command_line: /bin/cat $1 > $2
            input_ext: cat
            output_ext: py

Here we have defined ``.mat`` and ``.cat`` files as both creating new apps. In a real world example the ``command_line`` would be different.

Plugins
~~~~~~~

In the example above, you will see that home assistant is configured as a plugin (called HASS).
For most applications there is little significance to this - just configure a single plugin for HASS exactly as above. However, for power users this is a way to allow AppDaemon to work with more than one installation of Home Assistant and/or other plugins such as MQTT.

The plugin architecture also allows the creation of plugins for other purposes, e.g.
different home automation systems.

To configure more than one plugin, simply add a new section to the plugins list and configure it appropriately.
Before you do this, make sure to review the section on namespaces to fully understand what this entails, and if you are using more than one plugin, make sure you use the namespace directive to create a unique namespace for each plugin.
(One of the plugins may be safely allowed to use the default value, however any more than that will require the namespace directive. There is also no harm in giving them all namespaces, since the default namespace is literally ``default``
and has no particular significance, it's just a different name, but if you use namespaces other than default you will need to change your Apps to understand which namespaces are in use.).

Plugin Configuration
====================

In the required ``plugins:`` sub-section, there will usually be one or more plugins with a number of directives introduced by a top level name. Some of these are common to all plugins:

-  ``type`` (required) The type of the plugin.
-  ``namespace`` (optional) - which namespace to use. This can safely be left out unless you are planning to use multiple plugins (see below)

The rest will vary depending upon which plugin type is in use.

Configuration of the HASS Plugin
================================

To configure the HASS plugin, in addition to the required parameters above, you will need to add the following:

-  ``type:`` This must be declared and it must be ``hass``
-  ``ha_url`` (required for the ``hass`` plugin) is a reference to your home assistant installation and
   must include the correct port number and scheme (``http://`` or ``https://`` as appropriate)
-  ``ha_key`` should be set to your home assistant API password if you have one, otherwise it can be removed. This directive is deprecated - you should use the ``token`` directive instead
-  ``token`` (required) - set the long lived token for access to your hass instance (see later for a description of how to create a long lived access token)
-  ``cert_verify`` (optional) - flag for cert verification for HASS -
   set to ``False`` to disable verification on self signed certs, or certs for which the address used doesn;tmatch the cert address (e.g. using an internal IP address)
-  ``api_port`` (optional) - Port the AppDaemon RESTFul API will listen
   on. If not specified, the RESTFul API will be turned off.
-  ``app_init_delay`` (optional) - If sepcified, when AppDaemon connects to HASS each time, it will wait for this number of seconds before initializing apps and listening for events. This is useful for HASS instances that have subsystems that take time to initialize (e.g. zwave).
Optionally, you can place your apps in a directory other than under the
config directory using the ``app_dir`` directive.

e.g.:

.. code:: yaml

    app_dir: /etc/appdaemon/apps

An example of the HASS plugin could look like the following:

.. code:: yaml

    secrets: /some/path
    log:
      accessfile: /export/hass/appdaemon_test/logs/access.log
      errorfile: /export/hass/appdaemon_test/logs/error.log
      logfile: /export/hass/appdaemon_test/logs/appdaemon.log
      log_generations: 3
      log_size: 1000000
    appdaemon:
      threads: 10
      time_zone: <time zone>
      api_port: 5000
      api_key: !secret api_key
      api_ssl_certificate: <path/to/root/CA/cert>
      api_ssl_key: <path/to/root/CA/key>
      plugins:
        HASS:
          type: hass
          ha_url: <some_url>
          token: <token>
          cert_path: <path/to/root/CA/cert>
          cert_verify: True
          namespace: default


HASS Authentication
+++++++++++++++++++

HASS has recently moved to a new authentication model. For programs such as ``AppDaemon`` it is necessary to create a Long Lived Access Token, then provide that token to AppDaemon with the ``token`` directive in the HASS plugin parameters. To create a Long Lived Access Token for AppDaemon, do the following:

1. Login as the user that you want to create the token for and open the user profile. The profile is found by clicking the icon next to the ``Home Assistant`` label to the left of the web ui when the burger menu is clicked:

.. figure:: images/Profile.png
   :alt: Profile

2. At the bottom of the user profile is the Long Lived Access Tokens section. Click on "Create Token"

.. figure:: images/create_token.png
   :alt: Create Token

This will pop up a dialog that asks you for the name of the token - this can be anything, it's just to remind you what the token was created for - ``AppDaemon`` is as good a name as any. When you are done click ``OK``

.. figure:: images/popup.png
   :alt: Popup


3. A new dialog will popup with the token itself showing:

.. figure:: images/token.png
   :alt: Token

Copy this string and add it as the argument of the ``token`` directive in your HASS Plugin section:

.. code:: yaml

    token: ABCDEF

A real token will be a lot longer than this and will consist of a string of random letters and numbers, for example:

``eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiIwZmRkYmE0YTM0MTY0M2U2ODg5NDdiNmYxNjlkM2IwOSIsImlhdCI6MTUzOTU0NzM4NCwiZXhwIjoxODU0OTA3Mzg0fQ.zNwQqxKkx2ppUIS9Mm7rSLFiyaTNDP5HIlg7_SnxsS8``

4. A reference to your new token will be shown in the Long Lived tokens section, and you can revoke acess via this token at any time by pressing the delete icon. The token will last for 10 years.

   :alt: List


Configuration of the MQTT Plugin
================================

To configure the MQTT plugin, in addition to the required parameters above, you will need to add the following:


-  ``type:`` This must be declared and it must be ``mqtt``
-  ``namepace:`` (optional) This will default to ``default``
-  ``verbose:`` (optional) If wanting to view all data recieved by the plugin in the log, set this to ``True``. Its ``False`` by default
-  ``client_host:`` (optional) The IP address or DNS of the Broker. Defaults to 127.0.0.1 which is the localhost
-  ``client_port:`` (optional) The port number used to access the broker. Defaults to ``1883``
-  ``client_transport:`` (optional) The transport protocol used to access the broker. This can be either ``tcp`` or ``websockets`` Defaults to ``tcp``
-  ``client_clean_session:`` (optional) If the broker should clear the data belonging to the client when it disconnects. Defaults to ``True``
-  ``client_id:`` (optional) The client id to be used by the plugin, to connect to the broker. If not declared, this will be auto generated by the plugin. The generated the client id can be retreived within the app
-  ``client_user:`` (optional) The username to be used by the plugin to connect to the broker. It defaults to ``None``, so no username is used
-  ``client_password:`` (optional) The password to be used by the plugin to connect to the broker. It defaults to ``None``, so no password is used
-  ``client_cert:`` (optional) The certificate to be used when using SSL
-  ``verify_cert:`` (optional) This is used to determine if to verify the certificate or not. This defaults to ``True`` and should be left as True; if not no need having any certificate installed
-  ``event_name:`` (optional) The preferred event name to be used by the plugin. This name is what apps will listen to, to pick up data within apps. This defaults to ``MQTT_MESSAGE``
-  ``client_topics:`` (optional) This is a list of topics the plugin is to subscribe to on the broker. This defaults to ``#``, meaning it subscribes to all topics on the broker
-  ``client_qos:`` (optional) The quality of service (QOS) level to be used in subscribing to the topics
-  ``birth_topic:`` (optional) This is the topic other clients can subscribe to, to pick up the data sent by the client, when the plugin connects to the broker. If not specified, one is auto generated
-  ``birth_payload:`` (optional) This is the payload sent by the plugin when it connects to the broker. If not specified, it defaults to ``online``
-  ``will_topic:`` (optional) This is the topic other clients can subscribe to, to pick up the data sent by the broker, when the plugin unceremonously disconnects from the broker. If not specified, one is auto generated
-  ``will_payload:`` (optional) This is the payload sent by the broker when the plugin unceremonously disconnects from the broker. If not specified, it defaults to ``offline``

All auto-generated data can be picked up within apps, using the ``self.get_plugin_config()`` api

An example of the MQTT plugin could look like the following:

.. code:: yaml
     MQTT:
        type: mqtt
        namespace: mqtt
        verbose: True
        client_host: Broker IP Address or DNS
        client_port: Broker PORT Number
        client_id: Client_ID
        client_user: username
        client_password: password
        ca_cert: ca_cert
        client_cert: mycert
        client_key: mykey
        verify_cert: True
        event_name: MQTT_EVENT
        client_topics:
           - hermes/intent/#
           - hermes/hotword/#

Configuring a Test App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(This test app assumes use of the HASS plugin, changes will be required to the app if another plugin is in use)

To add an initial test app to match the configuration above, we need to
first create an ``apps`` subdirectory under the conf directory. Then
create a file in the apps directory called ``hello.py``, and paste the
following into it using your favorite text editor:

.. code:: python

    import appdaemon.plugins.hass.hassapi as hass

    #
    # Hello World App
    #
    # Args:
    #

    class HelloWorld(hass.Hass):

      def initialize(self):
         self.log("Hello from AppDaemon")
         self.log("You are now ready to run Apps!")

Then, we can create a file called apps.yaml in the apps directory and add an entry for the Hello World App like this:

.. code:: yaml

    hello_world:
      module: hello
      class: HelloWorld

App configuration is fully described in the `API doc <API.md>`__.

With this app in place we will be able to test the App part of AppDaemon
when we first run it.

Configuring the Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuration of the dashboard component (HADashboard) is described
separately in the `Dashboard doc <DASHBOARD_INSTALL.html>`__

Example Apps
------------

There are a number of example apps under ``conf/examples`` in the `git
repository <https://github.com/home-assistant/appdaemon>`__ , and the ``conf/examples.yaml`` file gives sample parameters
for them.
