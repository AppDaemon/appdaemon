# Description

AppDaemon is a loosely coupled, multithreaded, sandboxed python execution environment for writing automation apps for [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) home automation software.

# Installation

## Clone the Repository
Clone the **AppDaemon** repository to the current local directory on your machine.

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/acockburn/appdaemon.git
```

Change your working directory to the repository root. Moving forward, we will be working from this directory.

``` bash
$ cd appdaemon
```

# Install using Docker

``` bash
$ docker build -t appdaemon .
```

# Install locally

Before running `AppDaemon` locally you will need to add some python prerequisites:

```bash
$ sudo pip3 install daemonize
$ sudo pip3 install sseclient
$ sudo pip3 install configparser
$ sudo pip3 install astral
```

Some users are reporting errors with `InsecureRequestWarning`:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./hapush.py", line 21, in <module>
    from requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions import InsecureRequestWarning
ImportError: cannot import name 'InsecureRequestWarning'
```
This can be fixed with:
```
$ sudo pip3 install --upgrade requests
```

# Configuration

When you have all the prereqs in place, edit the `[AppDaemon]` section of the conf/appdaemon.cfg file to reflect your environment:

```
[AppDaemon]
ha_url = <some_url>
ha_key = <some key>
logfile = /etc/AppDaemon/AppDaemon.log
errorfile = /etc/AppDaemon/error.log
app_dir = /srv/hass/src/AppDaemon/apps
threads = 10
latitude = <latitude>
longitude = <longitude>
elevation = <elevation
timezone = <timezone>
```

- `ha_url` is a reference to your home assistant installation and must include the correct port number and scheme (`http://` or `https://` as appropriate)
- `ha_key` should be set to your key if you have one, otherwise it can be removed.
- `logfile` is the path to where you want `AppDaemon` to keep its main log. When run from the command line this is not used - log messages come out on the terminal. When running as a daemon this is where the log information will go. In the example above I created a directory specifically for AppDaemon to run from, although there is no reason you can't keep it in the `appdaemon` directory of the cloned repository. If `logfile = STDOUT`, output will be sent to stdout instead of stderr when running in the foreground.
- `errorfile` is the name of the logfile for errors - this will usually be errors during compilation and execution of the apps. If `errorfile = STDERR` errors will be sent to stderr instead of a file.
- `app_dir` is the directory the apps are placed in
- `threads` - the number of dedicated worker threads to create for running the apps. Note, this will bear no resembelance to the number of apps you have, the threads are re-used and only active for as long as required to tun a particular callback or initialization,
- `latitude`, `longitude`, `elevation`, `timezone` - should all be copied from your home assistant configuration file

The other sections of the file relate to App configuration and are described in the [API doc](API.md).

# Running

## Docker

Our Docker image is designed to load your configuration and apps from a volume at `/conf` so that you can manage them in your own git repository.

For example, if you have a local repository in `/Users/foo/ha-config` containing the following files:

```bash
$ git ls-files
configuration.yaml
customize.yaml
known_devices.yaml
appdaemon.cfg
apps
apps/magic.py
```

And a `appdaemon.cfg` file that pointed to these apps in `/conf/apps`:

```
[AppDaemon]
ha_url = <some_url>
ha_key = <some key>
logfile = /var/log/AppDaemon.log
errorfile = /var/log/error.log
app_dir = /conf/apps
threads = 10
latitude = <latitude>
longitude = <longitude>
elevation = <elevation
timezone = <timezone>
```

You can then run AppDaemon in Docker like so:

```bash
$ docker run -d -v $(pwd)/conf:/conf --name appdaemon appdaemon:latest
$ docker logs appdaemon
2016-08-21 14:18:04,367 INFO Got initial state
2016-08-21 14:18:04,371 INFO Loading Module: /conf/apps/magic.py
```

## Directly

You can run AppDaemon from the command line as follows:

```bash
$ ./bin/appdaemon.py conf/appdaemon.cfg
```

If all is well, you should start to see some log lines showing that various apps (if any are configured) are being initialized:

```

# AppDaemon arguments

usage: appdaemon.py [-h] [-d] [-p PIDFILE]
                    [-D {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}]
                    config

positional arguments:
  config                full path to config file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --daemon          run as a background process
  -p PIDFILE, --pidfile PIDFILE
                        full path to PID File
  -D {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}, --debug {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}
                        debug level

-d and -p are used by the init file to start the process as a daemon and are not required if running from the command line. 

-D can be used to increase the debug level for internal AppDaemon operations as well as apps using the logging function.

# Starting At Reboot
To run `AppDaemon` at reboot, I have provided a sample init script in the `./init` directory. These have been tested on a Raspberry PI - your mileage may vary on other systems.

# Operation

Since AppDaemon under the covers uses the exact same APIs as the frontend UI, you typically see it react at about the same time to a given event. Calling back to Home Assistant is also pretty fast especially if they are running on the same machine. In action, observed latency above the built in automation component is usually sub-second.

# Updating AppDaemon
To update AppDaemon after I have released new code, just run the following command to update your copy:

```bash
$ git pull origin
```
