        Home Assistant emits a ``state_changed`` event for every state change, which it sends to AppDaemon over the
        websocket connection made by the plugin. Appdaemon uses the data in these events to update its internal state.
        This method returns values from this internal state, so it does **not** make any external requests to Home
        Assistant.

        Other plugins that emit ``state_changed`` events will also have their states tracked internally by AppDaemon.

        It's common for entities to have a state that's always one of ``on``, ``off``, or ``unavailable``. This applies
        to entities in the ``light``, ``switch``, ``binary_sensor``, and ``input_boolean`` domains in Home Assistant,
        among others.

        Args:
            attribute (str, optional): Optionally specify an attribute to return. If not used, the state of the entity
                will be returned. The value ``all`` can be used to return the entire state dict rather than a single
                value.
            default (any, optional): The value to return when the entity or the attribute doesn't exist.
            copy (bool, optional): Whether to return a copy of the internal data. This is ``True`` by default in order
                to protect the user from accidentally modifying AppDaemon's internal data structures, which is dangerous
                and can cause undefined behvaior. Only set this to ``False`` for read-only operations.

        """Registers a callback to react to state changes.

        This function allows the user to register a callback for a wide variety of state changes.

        Args:
            callback: Function that will be called when the callback gets triggered. It must conform to the standard
                state callback format documented `here <APPGUIDE.html#state-callbacks>`__
            new (str | Callable[[Any], bool], optional): If given, the callback will only be invoked if the state of
                the selected attribute (usually state) matches this value in the new data. The data type is dependent on
                the specific entity and attribute. Values that look like ints or floats are often actually strings, so
                be careful when comparing them. The ``self.get_state()`` method is useful for checking the data type of
                the desired attribute. If ``new`` is a callable (lambda, function, etc), then it will be called with
                the new state, and the callback will only be invoked if the callable returns ``True``.
            old (str | Callable[[Any], bool], optional): If given, the callback will only be invoked if the selected
                attribute (usually state) changed from this value in the new data. The data type is dependent on the
                specific entity and attribute. Values that look like ints or floats are often actually strings, so be
                careful when comparing them. The ``self.get_state()`` method is useful for checking the data type of
                the desired attribute. If ``old`` is a callable (lambda, function, etc), then it will be called with
                the old state, and the callback will only be invoked if the callable returns ``True``.
            duration (str | int | float | timedelta, optional): If supplied, the callback will not be invoked unless the
                desired state is maintained for that amount of time. This requires that a specific attribute is
                specified (or the default of ``state`` is used), and should be used in conjunction with either or both
                of the ``new`` and ``old`` parameters. When the callback is called, it is supplied with the values of
                ``entity``, ``attr``, ``old``, and ``new`` that were current at the time the actual event occurred,
                since the assumption is that none of them have changed in the intervening period.

                If you use ``duration`` when listening for an entire device type rather than a specific entity, or for
                all state changes, you may get unpredictable results, so it is recommended that this parameter is only
                used in conjunction with the state of specific entities.
            attribute (str, optional): Optional name of an attribute to use for the new/old checks. If not specified,
                the default behavior is to use the value of ``state``. Using the value ``all`` will cause the callback
                to get triggered for any change in state, and the new/old values used for the callback will be the
                entire state dict rather than the individual value of an attribute.
            timeout (str | int | float | timedelta, optional): If given, the callback will be automatically removed
                after that amount of time. If activity for the listened state has occurred that would trigger a
                duration timer, the duration timer will still be fired even though the callback has been removed.
            immediate (bool, optional): If given, it enables the countdown for a delay parameter to start at the time.
                If the ``duration`` parameter is not given, the callback runs immediately. What this means is that
                after the callback is registered, rather than requiring one or more state changes before it runs, it
                immediately checks the entity's states based on given parameters. If the conditions are right, the
                callback runs immediately at the time of registering. This can be useful if, for instance, you want the
                callback to be triggered immediately if a light is already `on`, or after a ``duration`` if given.

                If ``immediate`` is in use, and ``new`` and ``duration`` are both set, AppDaemon will check
                if the entity is already set to the new state and if so it will start the clock
                immediately. If ``new`` and ``duration`` are not set, ``immediate`` will trigger the callback
                immediately and report in its callback the new parameter as the present state of the
                entity. If ``attribute`` is specified, the state of the attribute will be used instead of
                state. In these cases, ``old`` will be ignored and when the callback is triggered, its
                state will be set to ``None``.
            oneshot (bool, optional): If ``True``, the callback will be automatically removed after the first time it
                gets invoked.
            pin (bool, optional): Optional setting to override the default thread pinning behavior. By default, this is
                effectively ``True``, and ``pin_thread`` gets set when the app starts.
            pin_thread (int, optional): Specify which thread from the worker pool will run the callback. The threads
                each have an ID number. The ID numbers start at 0 and go through (number of threads - 1).
            **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword parameters to be provided to the callback function when it is triggered.

        Note:
            The ``old`` and ``new`` args can be used singly or together.

        Returns:
            A string that uniquely identifies the callback and can be used to cancel it later if necessary. Since
            variables created within object methods are local to the function they are created in, it's recommended to
            store the handles in the app's instance variables, e.g. ``self.handle``.

        Examples:
            >>> self.my_entity = self.get_entity("light.office_1")

            Listen for a state change involving `light.office1` and return the state attribute.

            >>> self.handle = self.my_entity.listen_state(self.my_callback)

            Listen for a change involving the brightness attribute of `light.office1` and return the brightness
            attribute.

            >>> self.handle = self.my_entity.listen_state(self.my_callback, attribute="brightness")

            Listen for a state change involving `light.office1` turning on and return the state attribute.
