    A list of API calls and information specific to the MQTT plugin.

    App Creation
    ------------

    To create apps based on just the MQTT API, use some code like the following:

    .. code:: python

        import mqttapi as mqtt

        class MyApp(mqtt.Mqtt:

            def initialize(self):

    Making Calls to MQTT
    --------------------

    AD API's ``call_service()`` is used to carry out service calls from within an AppDaemon app. This allows the app to carry out one of the following services:

      - ``Publish``
      - ``Subscribe``
      - ``Unsubscribe``

    By simply specifing within the function what is to be done. It uses configuration specified in the plugin configuration which simplifies the call within the app significantly. Different brokers can be accessed within an app, as long as they are all declared
    when the plugins are configured, and using the ``namespace`` parameter.

    Examples
    ^^^^^^^^

    .. code:: python

        # if wanting to publish data to a broker
        self.call_service("publish", topic = "homeassistant/bedroom/light", payload = "ON")
        # if wanting to unsubscribe a topic from a broker in a different namespace
        self.call_service("unsubscribe", topic = "homeassistant/bedroom/light", namespace = "mqtt2")

    The MQTT API also provides 3 convenience functions to make calling of specific functions easier an more readable. These are documented in the following section.
